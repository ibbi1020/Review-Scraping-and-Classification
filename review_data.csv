Food was very, very good",5,5,5,4
2,OpenTable Diner,10 out 10 recommend.... The entire experience was overwhelming amazing.  The entire staff was friendly and helpful.  I must start with the bread an assortment of delicious baked soft bread with olive oil. The crab cakes were moist paired with a pumpkin/squash hash ... Everything melted in my mouth. .

3,Eric,The staff put together a great tasting menu and win pairing for us,5,5,5,4

5,Jerry,"Great food and service in great setting.  Back room
Is perfect for special occasions.",5,5,5,5

12,Paul,"A favorite.  Such a nice experience, every time.",5,5,5,5
13,Nick,"My wife and I have chosen Black Salt for special occasion dinners over the years and have never had less than an exemplary experience.  It's not inexpensive but the quality of the seafood, presentation and service are outstanding.",5,5,5,4
14,Lynne,"Grilled sardines were great but Halibut overcooked and dry.
Plum tart sweet and good.

Very cold in back room.",4,3,5,5
15,Jill,All our dishes were outstanding.  The service was attentive but not fussy.  Highly recommend,5,5,4,4
16,Anne,"Another wonderful experience at Black Salt. Attentive, energetic staff, great ambience, easy to converse. The food is extraordinary, always fresh, a seafood haven. The seafood ceviche is my favorite appetizer, plenty to share or savor on your own.
The tuna poke bowl is great as an entree or starter if really hungry.  You cannot go wrong with any dish on the menu.
The key lime pie is always my go to dessert.
Worth the visit for any occasion.",5,5,5,5
17,Catherine,We love this restaurant and have been many times. But in our experience they have chronic time management problems. We may find another favorite place.,3,4,5,4
18,Shawn,Great food and great service!  Made our birthday celebration special!,5,5,5,4
19,Olena,"Overpriced. Food was plain. Crab Cakes had shells crumbs, nothing special, no flavor. Asked for decaf cappuccino four times, they brought me regular cappuccino after all. We paid $200 for lunch for 3 people.",3,1,3,4
20,Felicia,Service and food excellent as always. The best restaurant in DC.,5,5,5,5
21,SusanP,Just good good food!,5,5,5,5
22,Berinda,We felt rushed. Not accommodating in the back room.  I have never felt like the server wanted us to leave from the moment we sat.,3,3,3,3
23,Natalia,We had a wonderful celebration for my mother‚Äôs 81st birthday and we received fantastic service and special little touches along with a fantastic meal. Will definitely be coming back. Bravo!,5,5,5,5
24,Julie Lea,"I was treating my husband's assistant to her annual birthday dinner.  She had never been to Black Salt, and she lived every minute of it.  We started at the Bay with a drink and apps for happy hour then transitioned to a nice quiet booth for dinner.  The service was perfect, and the manager stopped by twice to introduce himself and welcome us.  What a special touch.  Doris will always have a great memory thanks to Black Salt staff!",5,5,5,5
25,Paul,"Great food.   Recommend the mussels and the clam chowder.  Both outstanding.  Great service
and relatively moderate noise levels",5,5,5,5
26,Ronald,"This place gives you a fantastic experience dining. We celebrated our wedding anniversary in the smaller separate room (a bit more quiet and much better ambiance). The service is stellar, as is the food. You can't go wrong with whatever you pick - and this makes it easy, because there are so many items to choose from, and they vary every time we come here. All in all, a superb experience all around.",5,5,5,5
27,Alan,"BlackSalt dinner was outstanding.   To start, they printed Happy Birthday with my name on our menus!   The service was excellent, the bisque, then fish entrees outstanding.   5 stars",5,5,5,5
28,Gaston,"Food: Easily could be a Michelin one-star, original, super fresh seafood, presented very well and with El Buli type sauces.
The Bullabaise had nothing to envy those at Nice and Cannes with great reduction and intense flavor.
The service was a bit inexperienced but very welcoming and overall effective
My only complaint was a significant delay from the appetizer to the main course the kitchen may have been having a hair day but this is easily fixed.
I will go every week if I lived in DC but will return on every trip.",5,5,4,4
29,Joseph,"We had lunch at Black Salt on a Saturday.  I began with fried whole Ispwich clams.  They were among the most flavorful and perfectly prepared fried clams I have ever eaten (and I grew up cooking and eating a lot of fried clams on the Massachusetts coast).  My wife began with the clam chowder.  She commented that it was a bit untraditional from a Massachusetts perspective - fewer potatoes, and closer to a broth than a milky chowder, but a generous portion of clams, as well as some mussels, and  three fried Ipswich clams floating on top of the chowder!  The result was a very flavorful variation on a traditional clam chowder.

For a main course I had the cornmeal crusted fish tacos, which were brimming with fish topped with among other things a delicious ancho chile crema, while my wife had steamed PEI mussels (Addie's version) with a broth of tomato, shallots, garlic, and lemon.  She has eaten a lot of steamed PEI mussels and said the broth and the mussels were superb.

Service could not have been better.  Unobtrusive but very friendly and efficient.  We stayed in our booth talking for over two hours and were not disturbed.

We could not have been more pleased with our meals or the service.",5,5,5,5
30,Barbara,"Always enjoy dining at Black Salt. Fresh fish, good service, nice atmosphere, very quiet usually at lunch, dinner noise a bit more robust.",5,5,5,5
31,Tara,"Amazing food! I went with the roasted chicken soup, the ribeye and the chocolate peanut butter torte for dessert. This was one of the best meals I‚Äôve ever had!",5,5,5,5
32,Jane,Second visit did not disappoint. Exquisite service and privacy in booth welcomed. The food was good but not over the top. Will continue to visit.,5,4,5,5
33,steve,Very good service. Some very good food. Some good food. In the end seems too expensive.,4,4,5,4
34,Carmen,"Outstanding food and service all around, tucked away in a cozy neighborhood.  Appreciated all the personalized touches by staff to celebrate a quiet wedding anniversary.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable and attentive without being intrusive.  Don‚Äôt let the fish market  storefront fool you.  The restaurant hidden behind was warm and charming.  A top fave discovery of the year.",5,5,5,5
35,Garrett,"Always delicious. Our go-to place for every special event, birthday or anniversary.",5,5,5,4
36,Wendy,"Black Salt is a neighborhood gem, always producing great seafood and other dishes, giving variety in their choices and an extra flare in the preparation. (You can‚Äôt get fried ipswich  clams anywhere else.)The staff is just wonderful. And they have a fine wine list,too.",5,5,5,5
37,Howard,"This is an OUTSTANDING seafood restaurant based on the food, the service and the ambience. The food is consistently top tier as is the service. There is a fish market counter in the very front of the restaurant so you are able to pick your seafood; having been to Blacksalt a number of times now, the seafood is always fresh as you will find. The bar area in the front is lively without being loud; the dining room in the back is quiet - so you can pick your preferred area. Give this restaurant an opportunity, I know you‚Äôll be back!",5,5,5,5
38,Tasha,"Really enjoyed the service, food and ambience for a casual mid-week birthday dinner for my husband. The personalized menu with special b-day wishes was much appreciated!!",5,5,5,5
39,OpenTable Diner,"There was a very poor waiter service. That was our wedding anniversary dinner that was not recognized at all but the host greetings. Not sure why bother to even ask the customer about a special occasion if nothing special you can provide. During the dinner our waiter did not stop by ONCE to ask how everything is or if we need anything. The bill was given by the bartender, not our waiter who could have at least thanked us for coming and dining there. We were speechless, the night was ruined by such ignorance and poor service.  Frankly, we are usually treated with much more respect at any other bar/restaurant that is not ranked as high as Black Salt.",2,3,1,3
40,Michael,Always a great experience at Black Salt. We started with fresh oysters and salad. Then Bouillabaisse and  halibut. Delish.,5,5,5,5
41,Stephanie,"Service is usually good, but was really slow a few nights ago.  Food was really good so I‚Äôm sure we will be back, but was just an off night for them.",3,5,2,4
42,Felicia,Excellent as always! My go to place. Service and food the best.,5,5,5,5
43,Jeff,"Excellence from beginning to end starting with Lucky Limes from PEI to mussels, soft-shell crabs, halibut with blue crab ravioli and finishing with key lime pie. Outstanding service! Highly recommended.",5,5,5,5
44,Mark,The food was absolutely marvelous. My relatives were in town from South Carolina and they simply raved about the delicious preparations of the appetizers and main courses.,5,5,5,5
45,Kamyar,This gem is among my favorite restaurants.  The menu items are always exciting and get updated from time to time.  Highly recommended.,5,5,5,5
46,Jonathan,One of the best if not the best seafood restaurant in DC!!,5,5,5,5
47,joyce,High quality but super expensive . Portions generous but once again overpriced. Fifty dollars for branzino at lunch is difficult to swallow. They were nice to give a chocolate brownie to our 98th birthday girl.,4,4,3,5
48,Mary,"We have been happy consumers of black salts hospitality for as long as it has been there.  ÔøºÔøº on the last several visits I have particularly appreciated the restaurants willingness to place us in as quiet a spot as possible as we and our friends find it harder to hear as we age. Lovely, knowledgeable service yesterday. One quibble: the salmon in the salmon burger was over done. It‚Äôs a good lunch dish and if you have it, I recommend you ask to have it cooked to your preference.",4,4,5,5
49,Maristela,"BlackSalt always delivers! I had oysters from Virginia, they were so fresh and briny, delicious. Then the seafood cocktail, with shrimp, lobster, scallops, crab meat, very yummy too. The desert was a caramel chocolate gateau with a peanut butter base, with salt caramel ice cream. The pairing wine was an excellent suggestion. I will go back soon! Best fresh seafood",5,5,5,5
50,Cynthia,Everything was wonderful! The reason for my 4 star rating on service is that our main courses were brought to the table and served while one guest was still enjoying his appetizer course. Not good!,5,5,4,5
51,SailsGuy,This was our first time visiting. We found the food and service to be outstanding in every way. Looking forward to another wine run (MacArthur Beverages next door) accompanied by dinner at BlackSalt.,5,5,5,5
52,marc,The quality of the food is outstanding. The price point is extremely high for simply prepared fish,4,4,4,4
53,Garrett,Our go-to place for every special event. Always save room for their desserts.,5,5,5,4
54,Daniel,"Our overall experience was excellent. The food was delicious. The ingredients were very fresh. The service was attentive. The wait staff were knowledgeable about the menu and willing to make changes to address allergies and preferences. The menu was not large, but was varied enough to be interesting. The entr√©es were creative and paired nicely with the side dishes. Everything was cooked to perfection. And yes, we paid top dollar for it. It was an expensive evening, in the 250 dollar range for two people (with wine) but worth it.Ôøº",5,5,5,4
55,Mark,"I have been dining at Black Salt since shortly after it opened 20 years or so ago.  I was there last night with a friend in the Wine Room.  I prefer to in that room, because the atmosphere is typically calmer and more charming than the main floor area.  Instead of entree, I chose two appetizers: (1) the Japanese Snapper Tartare‚Äîflavorful and light, and (2) the Moulard Duck breast, which was succulent, tender, flavorfully satisfying.  BlackSalt continues to aim to please, and last night it succeeded.",5,5,4,5
56,OpenTable Diner,"amazing experience. 10/10. delicious food, super kind & knowledgeable staff, and great ambience. went for a birthday dinner & would definitely recommend to everyone! although apps & entrees were outstanding, that strawberry rhubarb tart & key lime pie w/ passion fruit caramel were TO DIE FOR!!!!! if I were a local I would be ordering dessert weekly lol. amazing time, thank you!!!",5,4,5,5
57,JC,"As is always the case, the food was excellent, the wine list extensive and the service outstanding,",5,5,5,5
58,Michael,Overall excellent but the ‚Äúnon cash charge‚Äù feels a little petty given the overall price point of the restaurant.  And it‚Äôs something that is not identified until the check is presented.,5,5,5,5
59,JC,"The oysters weree fresh and delicious, the wines (including the port) werre outstanding, the table was very comfortable, and the service from Joan was courteous and helpful. I loved seeing some of the staff so elegantly dressed!

The only suggestion: temperature could be a bit warmer.",5,5,5,5
60,Calvillo,"It was amazing. Took my husband for his birthday, and they took care of us!",5,5,5,5
61,Jamie,"I celebrated my birthday in their wine room. AMAZING!  We had delish oysters to start. I did the lobster appetizer as my entree, which is great and lovely. To add even more applause, the sommelier was devine and gave us a few new wines to hunt down when we are home. Don't wait...just go!",5,5,5,5
62,Tim,"Another outstanding meal at Blacksalt. Freshest fish in the DMV and outstanding service. Have eaten here 4 times this year, and they always deliver. Prices are on the high side, but the quality of preparation is of equal value to the price. Highly recommend.",5,5,5,4
63,OpenTable Diner,We had a wonderful time and an amazing dinner. The service is always great! We really enjoy coming here.,5,5,5,5
64,DeryckB,"I hosted 4 guests to lunch at Black Salt on August 16th. The waiter was extremely knowledgable and was able to make recommendations based on the allergies and preferences of some members of the group. The service was very good and the food was exquisite. Everyone was very happy with their meals and the waiter - a Chinese Vietnamese gentleman - got high praise for being friendly, knowledgeable and ensuring that everyone‚Äôs food was to their satisfaction.",5,5,5,5
65,OpenTable Diner,Fantastic food.  The sardine appetizer was terrific.  The bouillabaisse was exceptional.  Highly recommend.,5,5,5,5
66,christine,Felt rushed even though there were hardly any customers at late lunch.,3,5,4,4
67,Denise F,"A wonderful treat to a designed dining as a gift for us.

Doug was excellent presenting all the dishes to our table.

A new experience for us.  Such a delight!

Thank you Chris and Joan, for visiting.

68,GreatFrench,Excellent meal from start to finish. Fresh and prepared perfectly. Attentive and professional service.,5,5,5,4
69,SimplyOutstanding,Great food. Great Service. Consistently excellent,5,5,5,3
70,AaronP,"The octopus was incredibly salty (we didn‚Äôt eat it), told the server about it and she still charged us. She also recommended way too much food",4,3,3,4
71,Virginia,As usual a wonderful lunch with cucumber gazpacho and grilled very tender tasty calamari!!,5,5,5,5
72,dorie,"Our first experience at BlackSalt was outstanding in every respect.  We were warmly greeted at the door, the wait service was par excellence, and the food was spectacular.  We had oysters, wood grilled calamari, Addie's mussels, bouillebaisse, and wood grilled branziono.  Everything was cooked to perfection and adorned with a huge amount of flavor.  It was a wonderful experience, and is highly recommended.",5,5,5,5
73,OpenTable Diner,"Best seafood ever & great service !
Such a lovely night.",5,5,5,5
74,Kristin,"Another stellar meal at Black Salt!  We were initially seated on the wine room, which is quieter but not the vibe we are looking for on a Saturday night out with friends.  The staff were very accommodating and promptly moved us to a nice table on the Main dining room.  From there, all was well‚Äîdrinks, food and service were all exceptional.  We were too full for dessert unfortunately‚Äînext time!  The sweet offerings are always tasty!",5,5,5,5
75,Patrick,"We love BlackSalt even if it is on the pricy side. 
We will go for special occasions and are never disappointed in their food preparation or presentation and the service is top notch (ie professional, helpful and not intrusive).
The wine room in the back is quiet enough for a conversation and that is much appreciated.",4,5,5,5
76,Pappy,Food and service were both awesome!  Black Salt is one of my all time favorite restaurants.,5,5,5,5
77,OpenTable Diner,Great.  ......................................::..,5,5,5,5
78,OpenTable Diner,"As always, BlackSalt delivered a lovely evening of food and fun.  This place is so amazing and always accommodating to help with reservations, wine choices, and food requests.  Thank you all!",5,5,5,5
79,OpenTable Diner,They charge 4% additional fee for credit card purchases. This is insulting to the customer in 2024 where very few people carry cash anymore. It is a cost of business that should be absorbed by the restaurant.,1,5,5,5
80,GrampaSteve,"The food was luscious! We both had the ahi tuna appetizer with sushi rice (which was, by a narrow margin, the most delicious ingredient). The crabcake entree and vegetables were full of flavor and the Branzino was wonderfully seasoned. The key lime pie was the best we'd ever had.",5,5,5,5
81,MireyaB,Amazing food and service. Loved the atmosphere and the cocktails.  The wine room was so elegant!,5,5,5,5
82,DCfoodLover,"BlackSalt doesn‚Äôt just serve good food. It provides a memorable experience.

Took my wife for an anniversary dinner. It was our first visit to BlackSalt. It‚Äôs been a long time since we‚Äôve experienced this level of excellent service. We felt honored and appreciated, and the food was delicious.

The back room of the restaurant is quiet and tastefully decorated. The lead server was attentive, providing good menu suggestions without being pushy. My wife does not have a big appetite, and he immediately offered to split our appetizers and entree, which they did beautifully. They looked like two perfectly prepared entrees.

We had a selection of fresh oysters, grilled calamari, and halibut with lobster strudel all well-prepared and delicious. In addition to our desserts, the restaurant provided a celebratory anniversary truffle, and souvenir menu.

Many restaurants serve good food, but post-pandemic service is at an all-time low, even at expensive places. (Pet peeve: ‚ÄúWho had the steak?‚Äù  Isn‚Äôt it your job to know?)

BlackSalt remembers it‚Äôs a memory, not just a meal.",5,5,5,5
83,Anton,"Prices have become stratospheric. And they charge a hidden 3% fee for credit card payments that only appears when the check arrives.  It is a nice place, and the food is good. But it is certainly not a place of 50$ entrees and hidden fees. A real pity, but no longer worth the visit.",1,3,3,3
84,SmartBlonde,Excellent service by the elegant and seasoned staff.  They do everything to make you feel comfortable.  We had the seasonal salad and my date had the Dover sole prepared table side.  Food was divine and atmosphere in the wine room was lively and effervescent.,5,5,5,5
85,LindsayJ,"Love Black Salt- amazing, interesting seafood menu. Service was a bit sparse.",4,4,4,5
86,VAVintner,BlackSalt always has the best quality seafood around.  Portions are generous and well prepared.,5,5,5,4
87,johnnyb,"The food was very good and the service provided by Carlos was excellent.  However, please invest in some decent silverware and make certain it's clean.",4,4,5,4
88,TrishS,"Always an amazing experience, whether for brunch or a special occasion. We went for our 28th wedding anniversary and had a wonderful time, and the food was must fantastic.",5,5,5,5
89,Craigo,"We are regulars and look forward to every tasty morsel and wine pairing. Last nights crab cakes, Dover sole, and other dishes were mouth watering and prepared perfectly. And the service was typically top notch from our favorite waiter and the team.",5,5,5,5
90,jamie,"First off, the price is high, but their were four of us and everyone loved their meal (we all had fish). Service was perfection and  wine list was quite good.  We may have just been lucky, but it was  easy to park  right out front on the street.  Highly recommend BlackSalt",5,5,5,4
91,an0nym0us,Dinner was fabulous as usual. The soft shell crabs were superb! And the Blue Hill oysters were delicious . The Rh√¥ne varietal wine worked well with both dishes.,5,5,5,5
92,DavidS,"Excellent, local seafood. Have enjoyed this restaurant on a number of occasions.",5,5,5,5
93,JeffL,"Always a great night, amazing food and personal terrific service",5,5,5,5
94,SarahM,Exceptional experience had by all.  Not our first visit and will not be our last.,5,5,5,5
95,Michael,"Best fish restaurant in the DC region. Excellent and broad menu, knowledgeable service, rear dining room is quiet.",5,5,5,5
96,scirox,"This is our favorite restaurant and saved for special occasions. This visit was very expensive, as expected but somewhat more than expected. In the past when we've gone for our anniversary, we have been pleased to have a mention of the celebration on the menu. That detail was missing this time; slightly disappointing, but not critical. The food was incredibly delicious, as expected, with one slight exception. The very expensive king salmon special came with a slightly heavy, brownish sauce that, while delicious, competed with the taste of the fish that I paid so much for. I had to pull out a section of just the flesh to get that flavor. There was a misunderstanding with our waiter that we wanted the leftovers to take home. To their credit, the staff made it right, though it caused a 20 minute delay.",4,4,4,5
97,AnneR,Great food. Wonderful service.  A keeper.  And then there is the fish market!,5,5,5,5
98,Bettina,"I LOVE Blacksalt, it is now my go-to, special occasion place!",5,5,5,5
99,OpenTable Diner,"Food was excellent. Server was very prompt. Service overall was excellent. The table next to us who seemed to be meeting a future daughter in law was excessive in the noise level from the perspective of me and wife. We understand the excitement, given we have children of our own, they are however younger.",4,5,5,4
100,OpenTable Diner,We had a fantastic evening at Blacksalt.  Food and service were spectacular- I would definitely recommend this restaurant for any occasion.,5,5,5,5
101,EllenF,Excellent service and so yummy! Great recommendations from all the staff! Spot on!,5,5,5,4
102,DcGeorgiaGal,Always a delicious meal at Blacksalt! I called ahead to see if they had any soft shell crabs available in the market and they were able to prepare them for one of my guests.  Absolutely perfect for her and the Caesar salad with grilled prawns was amazing as well. Love the changing menu and delicious salads.  And dont sleep on the cheeseburger either! thank you for a lovely lunch.,5,5,5,5
103,KLKWDC,"Blacksalt continues to be my favorite restaurant experience in DC.  The food is amazing, but the long term staff are even better.  It makes all the difference.",5,5,5,5
104,IvanH,"We never saw our server after ordering. Neither my husband nor I received the hash browns we ordered. No offer to refill our coffee, either. The food we received tasted excellent (as has been our experience many times in the past), but the lack of attention and the relatively small portion (or general lack of our order) left us disappointed and hungry.",3,5,2,3
105,Mark,"Excellent food with prices to match. Surprisingly noisy, even in the backroom. I guess dependent on presence of loud talkers. But a special place to dine, particularly seafood.",4,5,4,4
106,Linda,Fried clams were delicious! Belly clams at their best. Lobster bisque was a bit weak and thin. The service was excellent. But the room temperature was too cold!,5,5,5,4
107,OpenTable Diner,"Great seafood. Selection and prep were top notch. Even the steak was good. Fantastic deserts so don‚Äôt overload and skip desert.
Cool vibe. A little stinky up front from the fish market. The bar is nearby. Love the concept but ‚Äúsummer fish market‚Äù is never going to be a top selling scent. üòÉ",5,5,5,5
108,LawrenceG,"A lovely little place in a isolated neighborhood just west of DC with excellent seafood and attentive service. Wine list is a bit eclectic so you might need some guidance, and the wine prices are on the high side, but if you know enough  the choices are very nice.",5,5,5,4
109,luvfood2eat,we appreciated the quiet in the restaurant. The service was very good.,5,4,5,4
110,Pappy,Awesome seafood dishes as always! The mojitos from the bar were delicious too!,5,5,5,5
111,RossOnRestaurants,"Everything we ate was exceptional. Every aspect of the service was great, including the kitchen deciding to send out an additional appetizer so that they could re-fire my main course. A memorable dining experience.",5,5,5,5
112,FeliciaB,"Service and food excellent, as always. Thank - you.",5,5,5,5

116,GreatF,"Always consistent great fresh, clean healthy food!!",5,5,5,5
117,GarrettM,"Always a wonderful experience. We like so many things that we usually order a bunch of appetizers rather than individual entrees, so we can all share in the wonderful tastes. Then, leave some room for desserts.",5,5,5,5
118,OpenTable Diner,Very special experience dining in the back room‚Ä¶it felt private and perfect for our multigenerational dinner celebration. Our seven to seventy five year olds loved all the food and attentive staff. This is the perfect spot for any occasion.,5,5,5,5
119,OpenTable Diner,Great place with a very good fish selection - loved it,5,5,5,5
120,OpenTable Diner,Excellent food.  Over priced.  Also was a bit surprised to see their was a additional charge for paying with a credit card,4,4,4,4
121,BStarr99,"One of the finest all around dining experiences in the DMV.  Wait staff operate as a seamless team attending to every need, well paying paced and respectful. The entire layout of the venue provides a variety of dining settings for every mood. Highly recommend the Oysters Rockefeller and Bronzino main course.",5,5,5,5
122,StevenP,"One of DC/Maryland local icons. Place for seafood, regional feel, away from the touristy area of DC. Local feel but also attractive for out of town special occasions visitors.",5,5,5,5
123,OpenTable Diner,"My dining companion and I dined at Black Salt for her birthday. Devin was very helpful describing menu choices and giving us opinions on selections.  He recommended that we speak with JJ the sommelier regarding the wine list. JJ helped us pick the perfect bottle of wine. The chefs at Black Salt are experts at preparing fish to the perfect temperature - in my case an Ora King Salmon prepared medium. The accompaniments were flavorful and complemented the fish selections. It you enjoy seafood, Black Salt has a wide selection and has stood the test of time in Washington DC. They were GREAT acknowledging my dining companions birthday as well!",4,5,5,4
124,OpenTable Diner,The food was great and so was the service. It was a little expensive but worth it. I loved the casual vibe .,5,5,5,5
125,OpenTable Diner,"Service was ok, he really took us in and out in no time.",4,4,3,3
126,JCE9,They did a wonderful job helping us celebrate our 36th anniversary. The food and service were top notch. The oyster selection was fantastic and we tried them all. Best crab cakes in dc!,5,5,5,5
127,PeterT,"Great food, service.  Perfect for a special occasion or business dinner.  A bit expensive but it shows in the quality of the food, presentation and service.",5,5,5,5
128,OpenTable Diner,"Service was outstanding and the ambience fine.  But a $35 BlackSalt Caeser's salad that contained only two -- yes, that's right, only two -- ""wood-grilled"" prawns?  Outrageous.",2,4,5,3
129,Cliff,"We were celebrating a birthday, and asked for a quiet table, and we were seated in the Wine Room, and it was perfect.  We shared a calamari appetizer, and had halibut and crab cakes for the entrees.  We shared key lime pie for dessert, and the restaurant provided a special birthday dessert.  Service was excellent, and the food was delicious.",5,5,5,5
130,LaurH,"This was one of the best meals I have had, especially in DC.  The atmosphere in the back room is delightful.  The mussels were exceptional.  Can't wait to go back.",5,5,5,5

Amazing experience.
Excellent food and services.",5,5,5,5

136,JonT,Exceptionally great service. flavorful and fresh food,5,5,5,5
137,JasonK,"Consistently exceptional.

There is simply no one better in the mid Atlantic for a meal of fish.ÔøºÔøºÔøº",5,5,5,5
138,Lizzie,"Food was good, not great.  Service was fine, not exceptional. Extremely long wait between first and main courses.  I've had better experiences there.  Maybe they were just overwhelmed on a busy Saturday night.",3,3,3,3
139,JessicaH,"Wonderful, Rich, and interesting seafood. Great service in a lovely atmosphere. Noise level a little high. Pricey but worth it.",5,5,5,5
140,OpenTable Diner,"Very underwhelmed by the food that was served.
We got:
Fish tacos: it was ok. I wish the slaw had flavor. It got better after tabasco was added.
Thia mussels: best thing we had. The flavoring was good.
Salmon burger: was so disappointing. Salmon was dry, chips were salty.

Solid 3/5 for food. Cornbread as a starter added an extra .5 points!

Despite the food, service was phenomenal. Ôøº",3,2,5,3
141,OpenTable Diner,"Very good! Sat in the wine cellar, ordered the special (salmon), salad, oysters, and tuna. The chef happily made my dish gluten free.

Everything was great!",5,5,5,5
142,FeliciaB,"Food and service excellent, as always. My go to place.",5,5,5,5
143,LindaB,"Food and service were absolutely marvelous. The addition of Dorade is a good choice! Sitting in upstairs dining room is so k, but prefer the main dining room.",5,5,5,4
144,RobertR,Grossly overpriced. For some reason each entree now costs $20 more than a few years ago yet the food is the same. The Branzino was good but would have been better with a simpler sauce. We will not be back.,1,3,2,2
145,OpenTable Diner,"Outstanding as always. One of my favorite places in DC, and this time around we had the honor to dine at the same restaurant as President Biden and the First Lady as they were hosting the Japanese prime minister and wife. What an experience!!",5,5,5,5
146,OpenTable Diner,"Excellent service & food - nice, cozy experience outside of hustle & bustle of city",5,5,5,4
147,Kadmos,Not many choices for lunch. Prices well above the quality of the meal. Besides there are additional charges if you pay with credit card.,2,2,4,3
148,foodieambo,"BlackSalt is the place for seafood. The oysters alone are spectacular, and the fish is always perfectly prepared. I will report that I find I like their fish far more than I like their version of cornmeal-crusted soft shell crab.",5,5,5,5
149,WilliamP,"I ate here, four years ago, and came back to see if it was as memorable. I was not to be disappointed.  Very challenging to eat a three meal course given the portions, each portion is made with great care and focus. With an on-site bakery, fresh fish in daily with a great mix of nightly specials, and a solid wine list. Makes this a great restaurant to hit for a positive evening.",4,4,4,4
150,mac3,"We've been going to BlackSalt for many years, and it is consistently outstanding.  The food is incredible, the service is great, and the wine list is very good.",5,5,5,5
151,familyoffour,"From the first bite of stone crab claws, tender calamari to delicious entrees of rockfish, crab cakes and halibut all the way through to finishing touches with butterscotch pot de creme and key lime pie the food was excellent.  The recommended wine pairing of a sancerre was fantastic.  Can't remember the last time when we ate out that every thing was wonderful.  Thank you for a lovely evening.",5,5,4,4
152,MonaK,The food was most delicious and the service was excellent. The manager and the waiters were wonderful.,5,5,5,5
153,Stevenson,"Crab cake was superb!  Service attentive. A tad expensive, but very good for a special lunch or dinner.",5,5,5,4
154,OpenTable Diner,Overall good experience.The appetizers of lobster and calamari were on the tough side and not the best value for cost.Service was good.,4,4,5,4
155,Virginian,Excellent service and menu with good choices. I'd recommend to friends!,5,5,5,4
156,KristinA,The pricing is just a bit high.   I don't know if I would come back when work is not paying.   $53 starting point for a piece of fish is just too hard to stomach.  Ans $20 starting point for a so-so glass of Chardonnay is just too much.  I am a neighbor and frequent all of our great spots in the hood here in palisades.,3,3,4,4
157,OpenTable Diner,"My latest favorite place.
Everything was great - except this review form!",5,5,5,5
158,OpenTable Diner,One of the best restaurants in DC hands down. Every time I dine here always have great service and amazing food!,5,5,5,5

160,SueF,Always fabulous! Particularly when chef prepares the fish his way. Service always superb!,5,5,5,5
161,john,"We are long time diners at Black Salt, and always enjoyed our meals; however, last night was very disappointing and not sure if we will return.  We understand the need to raise prices, but we found it difficult to find anything on the menu (daily specials and regular) that we wanted to order. The calamari appetizer and tuna and crab cake main courses were underwhelming, at best. The bread and olive oil were the only enjoyable part of the meal.

Service and ambiance were fine, but sorry to feel the need to write this revue.",2,1,3,3
162,Susan,"For the food, service and ambience there is no place in the Washington DC region I would rather eat than BlackSalt. It's in a slightly out-of-the-way neighborhood, but it's my neighborhood so it works perfectly for me. The food is creative, the balance is perfect and the flavors are fresh and compelling. The staff - at all levels - is professional and outstanding. Bravo!",5,5,5,5
163,MrYummy,"I hadn‚Äôt been to Black Salt in years and I was consistently disappointed. The grilled calamari were chewy, and both the halibut and bronzino were overdone. Surprisingly, the best part of my meal was the salad.",2,2,4,4
164,SandyP,"Celebrated our anniversary and the menu we got had a special greeting from the restaurant (nice touch - set the stage for a memorable experience)!  Food was excellent, service outstanding!",5,5,5,5

166,JeromeJ,We had a great time at Black Salt the food was delicious and service great our waiter Ryan was attentive and saw our every need,5,5,5,5
167,gfwareagle,"Always a winner.  We went for Sunday brunch and enjoyed a salad, their one-of-a-kind clam chowder and their eggs Benedict Ponchartain.",5,5,4,4
168,YouOnlyLiveOnce,About as average as it gets. Not good for the price but fine if you need a good place to take elderly people.,3,3,3,3
169,OpenTable Diner,Overall it was a very nice evening and the food was excellent except the steak. We would come a lot more often if there were better non seafood options for the one non seafood lover in our family.,4,4,4,4
170,TomA,"The food is always excellent‚Ä¶same for service!

Dinning experience is the best in DMV.

Go and enjoy.",5,5,5,5
171,OpenTable Diner,"The menu and wine list has changed since our last time dining at BlackSalt. Actually had to return a bottle of French wine that was undrinkable/bitter.Fortunately, the wine server suggested a much better California wine that went well with the entrees. The food was great, as we expected.",4,5,4,5
172,NB41,Food slections from varied menu  and service were excellent. Prices have definitely increased since last visits and administrative fee for using credit card? What's that about at a restaurant where everyone uses a credit card?,4,5,5,5
173,quartet,"Black salt has become wildly over priced for what it is. Entrees with no sides over $50. Appetizers $30.00. Now there‚Äôs a
4 % surcharge on top of that .  Crab cakes were mediocre and more than $50. Four of us ate there -only one bottle of modestly  priced wine, no cocktails , no coffee or after dinner drinks. split two desserts and the  bill was $600. That‚Äôs just too much‚Äî for that cost I‚Äôll go to a fine dining restaurant.",3,3,4,3
174,SuzyS,Enjoyed every minute of our dinner at Blacksalt! Staff were very attentive and everyone‚Äôs food was absolutely delicious! Highly recommend the black pepper tuna with soba noodles. All together a lovely dining experience.,5,5,5,5
175,FeliciaB,Always excellent - food and service love sitting in the wine room. Many thanks,5,5,5,5
176,OpenTable Diner,"Great place to have a small personal business meeting. We met with a customer to review new technology that was approved and sold in the US, but was not offered to them prior to this meeting, because of limited product availability. All in all, the meeting went will, the food was great, service was excellent. noise level was moderate and manageable.",5,5,5,4
177,Papaya,Food is amazing. We loved the seafood tower so very much. Our only wish was that they served hot fries at the restaurant. There‚Äôs nothing like raw oysters and hot fries on the side.,4,4,5,5
178,nycfoodie,"The wine was great.

The sardines had bones in them.

The clams were tasty.

The crabcakes were expensive $56 and were not made with lump crab even though the waitress said they were.

The mussels were ok, not great.

Overall for a $200 bill we were disappointed.

Would we go back?

NO",3,3,4,3
179,ISGreviews,"As always, the food was outstanding. And the service was perfection.",5,5,5,5
180,Matt52,First time customer...  the staff couldn't have been nicer... We were in the less bustling backroom which was perfect for this birthday celebration night out.  The food was outstanding throughout all the courses.  Couldn't have been a better evening and meal...  Thanks so much.  PS.  We have already recommended the restaurant to numerous friends...,5,5,5,5
181,Annette,We really enjoyed BlackSalt. The seafood was so fresh and the selections covered everything from caviar to shellfish to finfish! Loved having a little bit of it all. Service was good too. Our server was very well informed about the menu and made great recommendations when asked. We also liked the ambiance though we will be happier when the outside dining is available. We will definitely be back!,4,4,4,4
182,Alice,"I ordered the salmon burger for lunch.  It was very dry and bit too spicy for my taste.  My friend had the fish taco which she found acceptable, but not outstanding. The dessert we ordered to share (peanut butter and chocolate confection) was outstanding.  Service was spotty.  No one ever asked us how we liked our meals, but then again, we enjoyed sitting and chatting for almost two hours with little disturbance.",3,2,2,3
183,DemetriusB2017,"This restaurant offers a delightful experience with its inviting ambiance and exceptional food. The warm atmosphere enhances the dining pleasure, making it a perfect choice for those seeking both a cozy environment and delicious culinary delights. Highly recommended!",5,5,5,5
184,OpenTable Diner,Been coming to this restaurant since they opened almost 20 years ago and the food has remained excellent - i highly recommend it!,5,5,5,5
185,Anny,Outstanding as always from the service to the food.,5,5,5,5
186,DonnaP,Seafood is always fresh and well prepared. I noticed prices have risen and a dinner for 2 with one glass of wine is well over $135.,4,4,4,3
187,OpenTable Diner,"We could have gotten by just sharing a couple starters. We chose the pear salad and rock shrimp spaghetti. Despite no longer being hungry, the perfectly cooked halibut was delightful.
Service was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.
Sitting in the wine room was perfect for conversation- although initially the temperature was a little low for comfort.
Will definitely return",5,5,5,3
188,Partridgepeg,"BlackSalt serves all kinds of great seafood, but to us their oysters are the diamonds in the crown.  They always offer a good varity from the east and west coast, and the oysters they serve are the best quality.  One thing, however, may be overlooked by some folks, but not by real oyster lovers is the way their oysters are shucked.  The Oysters at BlackSalt come to you perfectly shucked, loose from the shell, and swimming in their marvelous sea juices.  You can literally drink and eat at the same time, and (February) is the best time to do so.  We enjoyed our oysters for lunch, but I'm sure that their fine shuckers are on duty all day...",5,5,5,5
189,Chris,Great food and service.  The New Calm Chowder was fantasic.,5,5,5,5
190,BarryC,"This is a great place to go for a quality fish or seafood meal in the District. Service was gracious and professional. The quality of the food was remarkable, as agreed by 5 of us, each ""picky"" in our own way. Bring cash to avoid credit card fee -- and lots of it, especially if you are getting an appetizer, drink and/or dessert (memorable) in addition to your entree. Free street parking after 6:30pm. Quiet neighborhood and casual vibe. Upscale dining. Great for a special occasion, especially for groups of 6 or fewer.",5,5,5,4
191,Bettina,Excellent all around - - a wonderful birthday celebration!,4,4,4,4
192,JaNo,It's very nice; VERY expensive for what it is. I think $56 for cod is over the top.,4,5,5,4

194,AshleyF,"Wonderful fish of all kinds!  I recommend the lobster roll and fish tacos especially, but I have never had a bad meal at BlackSalt!",5,5,5,5

198,FeliciaB,Excellent as always - food and service excellent. Thank-you.,5,5,5,5
199,KimF,"First time at BlackSalt. Crab cake was fine. One tablespoon of coleslaw, chips were fine. I found it overpriced. 
Service was great. 
We arrived almost at opening so it was very quiet.",3,3,5,4
200,ErnestL,"Ok, I juest rated Black Sale at quiet, but that only applies to the back room, where we were seated. For us, a party of four with plenty to chat about, including how great the food and service was, it was exactly what we wanted. Further forward in the main rooms it was louder, not annoyingly so, but with a more upbeat energetic vibe. 

The food was fantastic, from the presentation (brilliant) to the serving temperature. Black Salt is not cheap...our part of four racked up a bill of just under $700, so it's not something we'd do casually. But we didn't feel like the experience wasn't worth it.",5,5,5,5
201,OpenTable Diner,JJ runs a terrific restaurant! We felt like family.,5,5,5,5

207,OpenTable Diner,"The food here was really good! We went for my son‚Äôs birthday and got the grilled octopus appetizer, seafood cocktail, ribeye, and crab cakes. They were all really, really good!

211,JonathanP,"Service was great! Food was pretty good . Fried clams were heavily breaded though crisply fried. They lacked the briny taste of fresh fried clams however. Flounder fluke filets were similarly well prepared but lacked a certain savory fresh sparkle you usually get there. The other shared app, scallops, were delicious; and my dining companion really enjoyed his fresh tuna.",4,4,5,4
212,OpenTable Diner,"Never going back again  bad service all around , black salt went down hill no wonder it‚Äôs empty .",2,4,1,2
213,PTJPTJ,"The food here is always outstanding.  I started with clam chowder; I‚Äôve never tasted better.  I moved on to the halibut, which was a surprisingly large portion (more than I could eat).  It was paired with bacon, butter beans and spinach.  I had butterscotch pudding for dessert.  Service was exceptionally attentive.",5,5,5,3
214,NMT2018,"We recently dined at this establishment and unfortunately experienced an unsettling incident. While seated at my table, my date observed a mouse in the vicinity across our table, which raised concerns regarding hygiene and safety.

As we decide to leave, We approached the manager wearing a suit and tie at the cashier and explained the situation. He calmly smiled and thank us for bringing the incident to him. We explained the location of where the mouse wast last seeing and asked him to go to wine room area since other people were eating.

We never got an apology or regrets and it was not a surprise to manager to hear this situation. We wanted to bring this matter to the adminstrator‚Äôs attention promptly, as I believe it's crucial for the well-being of all patrons. I kindly request that chef investigate and take the necessary measures to address the issue, implementing effective pest control to ensure a clean and secure dining environment.

I appreciate a prompt attention to this matter and trust that someone after this review will take the appropriate actions to maintain the high standards I have come to expect from your establishment.",1,3,3,4

220,ScottA,Outstanding food (Dover sole and Alaskan Halibut) with good service. Nice ambiance and relatively quiet environment. Server could have been more attentive - lost points when we had to request a bus boy to bring us the coffee I had ordered with my dessert. Coffee arrived when I was half way through an excellent dessert.,4,5,4,4

226,Olivia,"Really wonderful-the quality of the fish and the preparation are amazing. A range of different types of fish and types of preparation make it hard to choose, but you‚Äôll be pleased. The very best fried clams we‚Äôve had in the DMV, as good as you‚Äôll find in Maine. The desserts are luscious. The service is attentive and personal.

230,ValleyDiner,"We have dined here annually for years and will continue to do so.  However, the menu is scaled back and the wine selection options are the poorest ever.  While menus are ever updated, the skew away from continental to more international influences sacrificed clarity of focus.  From the tuna tartare to the elaborate  coconut cream pie, every category contained fewer appealing options.  The wine list likewise lacked focus both as to food compatibility and price-point spread.  The knowledgeable waiter displayed an unusual level of inattentiveness quite out of character for this restaurant. Overall, this neighborhood gem requires some TLC to return the burnish to its luster.",3,3,3,4
231,HelenaH,Delicious!!! Crab cakes out of this world and great ambience.,5,5,5,5

238,MRJR,"Bring lots of cash! Nice menu, delicious food and attentive service. We did not appreciate the 4% added charge for paying with a credit card.  The restaurant could do a better job of informing their clientele in advance of their fee policy since it is not the norm and most people don‚Äôt carry alot of cash. Even more preferable would be to modestly increase their prices to cover the fee and offer a discount for cash.",4,5,5,4

242,FrankP,Addies Mussels are the best in Washington DC The fish is always consistently fresh and cooked with perfection . Great wine selection . The grilled Octopus is also one of my favorites as well . Nicely charred on each side . Just after dinner your stomach will tell you to return again and again as i have done. As a native Washingtonian i can tell you to visit and enjoy the greatness,5,5,5,5

252,DianeC,Our favorite restaurant in the city and fortunately walking distance for us. Food is always great and the vibe is just right,5,5,5,5
253,OpenTable Diner,"I called to ask if my reso could be changed from 5:15 to 5:30 and the host happily accommodated me. I requested a quiet table and was seated in the wine cellar where lovely jazz music was playing lightly in the background. On arrival to the table, the gracious host took my coat and checked it for me, which I appreciated. While the chairs are comfy and the tables are spacious, the room could use a change in lighting and/or decor to switch the vibe from buttoned up corporate to intimate private dining. But quiet it was!

The service throughout our meal was caring but not overbearing; present but not hovering. Drink orders were quickly filled and the flow of the courses was perfect. 

Everything we ate was delicious and fresh. You really can‚Äôt go wrong with any of the menu selections. Everything was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. The coconut desert special was a delectable ending to a delightful night. 
Thanks to all at BlackSalt!",5,5,5,5

264,GailW,"First table, a booth, was in a noisy area. Restaurant nicely accommodated moving us to a quieter table. Good food. Good service.",5,5,5,4
265,OpenTable Diner,Food very good. Dessert really fantastic. Not thrilled with the cc fee (bring cash?),5,5,5,4
266,OpenTable Diner,Thai mussels and  Addie‚Äôs mussels were delicious. Entrees all fish dishes excellent.  Butterscotch dessert excellent.  Best bottles of wine.  My Friday night go too..,5,5,5,5
267,EdwardG,Top notch seafood in an environment that is increasingly chaotic. Service ranged from indifferent to ignorant...there is no.contest to see who can fill a wine glass the highest. Prices have become ridiculous. $25 appetizer and >$50 entree and then the nerve to add a 4% credit card fee. Obnoxious beyond belief. Why add $15 to a $400 bill? It all shows how impervious DC residents are to these accumulated slights.,4,5,1,3
268,davidw,"We all had Caviar with Champagne ,then we had a seafood cocktail and for our entree we all had Dover sole with a nice. Montrachet",4,4,5,4
269,AnyaR,Love it had blast. The service was great no complaints.,5,5,5,5
270,PeteM,"The martinis were excellent, the food was very good, and the service was excellent. It does get a bit noisy. It would good to include new things on the menu more often.",5,5,5,4
271,Benk,"Second time we dined here in two months, something we almost never do. Menu had changed in the meantime, but both times we were delighted beyond expectations with very tasty and creative dishes, including dessert. I believe we are going to become ""regulars"" here for our date nights!",5,5,5,4

Always happy here!",5,5,5,5
277,SuzyS,What has gone wrong?! So disappointed in a recent dining experience at Blacksalt. I have been dining at this restaurant with my family for years and always have had excellent meals and impeccable service. Tonight that was far from the case‚Äîfood was in some cases borderline inedible. Service was poor to average and the prices exorbitant. Will be awhile before I return.,2,1,3,3
278,Mari,"Consistently wonderful! Great service, great food, easy access.",5,4,5,5
279,KatyKeats,"We've been eating at Black Salt for years. The food is always excellent, but something has gone wrong with the food service since the pandemic. The wait for food and drinks orders is far too long, and given that we've now experienced it several times it seems fair to say there is a consistent problem. We were there at 7 pm on a Friday. Maybe that's where we went wrong. We won't book at that time again.",3,4,2,3

284,OpenTable Diner,"My fianc√© and I were visiting from Arizona, a state that unfortunately lack‚Äôs of good quality seafood. Dinning at BlackSalt was a truly amazing experience, from the amazing impeccable service to the top quality seafood. JJ recommended amazing wines by the glass for us and the whole team was very welcoming and just amazing in every front of service.
I highly recommend to anyone visiting to come try this amazing jam!!!!",5,5,5,5
285,DeborahB,"Yay fresh Pacific Northwest oysters which I love! A great riff on clam chowder. My husband loved the fish tacos. A nice little birthday lunch with unobtrusive, good service.",5,5,5,5
286,TeddyMac56,"Hadn't been back for lunch in a while but found food and staff to be as good as I recalled. Menu changes are a given, but saw some old friends (clam chowder and mussels) remained. Fish tacos were excellent and a nice change of pace for me.",4,4,4,4
287,OpenTable Diner,"Great food, excellent service (thank you Devin), pleasant ambiance for our anniversary. Looking forward to coming back.",5,5,5,5
288,john,"As always, Black Salt is a great neighborhood gem!",4,4,4,4
289,MattyeP,"The main plus was the service.  The servers were attentive. Since the restaurant came so very highly recommended, we expected more from the food.  The photos on the reservation site are enticing, so we expected a great experience.  However, my order was disappointing.  The lobster roll was served on a buttery toasted croissant which made the sandwich too sweet and greasy.  The romaine lettuce in the vegetable salad did not appear to be fresh.  The salad was edible because of the poached apples and caramelized pecans.  If I ever returned to this restaurant, I would not order these items.",2,1,3,3
290,DrewB,Great service and staff and food. Will was our waiter and he did a great job to help celebrate my wife‚Äôs birthday.,5,5,5,5
291,hoya18,"Overall a disappointment!  We have dined at Black Salt for years but our experience fell far short this time. It used to be a go-to spot for special occasions with family and friends but don‚Äôt think if is worthy of that any more. The atmosphere was more noisy neighborhood bistro than fine dining yet the prices were very high.  There was a child seated in a stroller in the middle of the main dining room shrieking most of the evening and service was slow.  People at tables around us were even talking to us and others about the shrieking child with oblivious parents ruining their very expensive meal.  We spoke to both the waiter and manager twice about the situation and were told ‚Äúsorry, nothing we can do‚Äù and ‚Äúthey are regulars‚Äù as if that made it okay for them to ruin everyone else‚Äôs experience.  No offer to move us to another table, comp our wine, dessert, anything. Very surprising and disappointing as they were aware of the situation, knew it was unacceptable yet chose to do nothing despite ample opportunity.",3,3,3,1
292,Lisay,Both excellent a lovely evening and a beautiful setting,5,5,5,5
293,OttoM,Food was ok. The room was freezing which adversely impacted the ambience and the enjoyment of the food. Service was just ok.,4,5,4,3

296,OpenTable Diner,"We love dining here and hadn‚Äôt been in a while. We were so thrilled with every aspect of our dinner last night! We had a dear friend in town and talked it up a bit and she said it was beyond what we had described.

There are not enough stars because you deserve more!!",5,5,5,5
297,JustChasetheMoo,"Although we always enjoyed the old menu, the new chef and menu exceeded our expectations. The crab cakes were phenomenal! Great service and drinks as always.",5,5,5,5
298,MarieD,"What a great experience. Firstly, the restaurant was QUIET! We didn‚Äôt have to speak louder to hear one another and that was needed after not having seen my friend in over 5 years. The food was delicious. It was presented beautifully and piping hot upon arrival.",5,5,5,5
299,OpenTable Diner,"This staff went above and beyond to make our mileÔøºstone birthday group dinner a fun celebration. They presented a customized happy birthday menu, and delivered a little birthday cake surprise for dessert. Cocktails and food were delicious. Service was impeccable. Will definitely be dining at BlackSalt again.",5,5,5,5

303,HaleyK,"I used to love Black Salt. I found the my lobster roll extremely pricy for the value.
The waiter was overwhelmed.
I‚Äôll certainly try again because a restaurant such as Black Salt is not about one time",3,2,3,3
304,OpenTable Diner,I visit was phenomenal. This staff and the host were incredible. The food was the best food that I have had in months and years.,5,5,5,5
305,SachaJ,"The team here works very hard to make sure you enjoy your meal. The meal was very fair and basic. This place has been around for a long time and I think is over rated. The crab cakes, which is very basic seemed like they came off an assembly line and the key lime dessert, like it came out of a box.

Its like time stopped in BlackSalt and there are so many better choices for the money.",3,2,3,3
306,Undercover,"Grilled calimari lacked much calimari, and the sauce was too thick; calimari taste was not all that evident.   Fried clams were barely warm enough, and here, too, the taste  was almost indistinct.   The Pemequid oysters were great.   So, for this restaurant, it was kind of an off-experience.   But we will be back.",3,3,4,5
307,Rozer,"I dined with a friend I was hoping to treat, and we were so disappointed. We each ordered two dishes and said we were fine with them all coming at once. Nearly an hour passed between the delivery of his hummus and my salad and our other orders. We asked REPEATEDLY  about our other dishes, were assured they were on their way, and then nothing. There was plenty of staff on site but nobody cared enough to see it through. ... My salad was limp and tasteless, the hummus was watery and nearly flavorless. And at these prices? Nope, not going back.",2,2,1,3
308,JohnK,Overall great time. I've been to BlackSlat many times. And the food and drinks are always excellent. The service is always a miss or hit. Though services keeps a par level. They also were kind of enough to let us stay almost 45mins past closing. Again there service is always at par or better.,5,5,4,5
309,OpenTable Diner,We loved it from start to finish! They allowed us to bring in our special wine for a reasonable corkage fee ($25). Our favorite Reuben egg rolls are always the best way to start!!!,5,5,5,5
310,OpenTable Diner,Loved it! We ate there 20 years ago when we were college students and the food was just as good today as it was then!,5,5,5,5
311,GarrettM,Our go-to celebration spot where the food and drinks and ALWAYS delicious,5,5,4,4
312,PietroF,"Food absolutely excellent.
And service impeccable",5,5,5,5
313,Christina,"A friend told me the grilled calamari were exception at Black Salt.  I've always eaten Addie's Mussels, so my friend and I ordered the calamari for a change.  They were saturated in olive oil, too greasy for my taste.",3,2,3,5
314,Biltmoredude,"Great find, we'll be back!  We went specifically for the fried clams, and that was not on the brunch menu, but the chef made them for us regardless...  Perfect birthday brunch!",5,5,5,4
315,syhs,The Black Restaurant Group does not disappoint and BlackSalt was a treat.,5,5,5,5
316,OpenTable Diner,What a great night! Our waiter was extremely attentive and the food was delicious. They made a special menu for our 15 year anniversary which was so thoughtful.,5,5,5,5
317,Georgia,"Staff most disagreeable with request to changing table.  Originally placed next to serving station.  Wine by the glass menu poor. Overall, very bad attitude (with 2 exceptions) from staff.  Disagreeable experience",1,3,1,3
318,Date,Our server was very solid. The food was pretty good but the price was very high.,4,3,5,3

320,Sandy,Outstanding food and service. Calamari and bronzino were delicious and beautifully plated.,5,5,5,5

323,GlennK,"We had an excellent anniversary dinner. We were welcomed with menus that noted our celebration,  a nice touch. We enjoyed our drinks and food. Both the fish and scallops were perfectly prepared. Service was attentive but not too much so.",5,5,5,4
324,KathleenD,This was our first time dining at BlackSalt and the seafood preparation was excellent. Each course held it's own and combined was a dining delight!,5,5,5,4

328,maria,Calamari was great and so was the branzino! The flourless chocolate dessert was the favorite of the group.,5,5,5,5

333,OpenTable Diner,"I‚Äôve been to Black Salt for HH and walk-in dining, but had no idea and was pleasantly surprised they had a fine dining experience in the back of the restaurant! What a special treat! Also appreciated that our dishes‚Äîwhile shared‚Äîwere separated so we each had our own plates!",4,4,4,4
334,Dallasd,"Great place and amazing food!
Will come back soon
Food and desert were great!",5,5,5,4
335,PTJPTJ,The food here never disappoints.  I started with a peach salad and moved on to the clam chowder and halibut.  I finished with butterscotch pot de creme.  Drinks were refilled promptly.,5,5,4,4

342,dhva,"BlackSalt is always a great meal. The staff is knowledgable and friendly, and the food is always outstanding. Each room has a unique feel, allowing for different experiences for repeated visits. We went for my wife's birthday and they even covered little details like wishing her happy birthday on our menus. Small gestures that improve the overall experience!",5,5,5,4
343,MartyS,Black Salt is a neighborhood treasure with incredibly fresh seafood. The service team is top-notch and we appreciate the outstanding wine list. We will be back again soon.,5,5,5,5
344,Bethel,"Wonderful food, lively atmosphere, great service! I always enjoy dining here!",5,5,5,5
345,JayB,Definitely the best seafood dinner I have  had in DC area. The wait staff was engaged and very accommodating.A thoroughly enjoyable experience.,5,5,5,5
346,PetePM187,Our halibut came with a asparagus mash that was unbelievable. Crab cakes are the best I've eaten in my life; peaches and berries were also outstanding. You would not expect this quality of food as you approach the entrance (fish store).  We'll comeback.,5,5,5,5
347,DougB,Used to be my favorite restaurant in DC. Been going for over 13 years. Still good but has lost a bit of its quality. Main course came before appetizers were finished. The seafood stew was fresh but not well seasoned.,3,3,4,4
348,OpenTable Diner,BlackSalt is one of our favorite DC area restaurants. Get have the freshest seafood and excellent service. This restaurant is a must for anyone that loves seafood!!,5,5,5,5
349,JGJ2,"Food is unexcelled and the service was top-notch.  I asked for a relatively minor modification to the way my entree was listed on the menu -- it was a lobster roll, which I asked to be prepared in the so-called ""Connecticut"" style, i.e., with butter instead of mayonnaise, and warmed up -- and the kitchen was entirely accommodating.  The restaurant was busy on a Friday at lunchtime and there was a high level of noise from other patrons, which made it somewhat difficult to hold a conversation with my dining companion.  And the experience will make a generous dent in your wallet.  But overall the lunch was well worth it, and I won't hesitate to return.",5,5,5,4
350,IraH,Some of her best seafood in DC! Ipswich clams are a must!,5,5,5,5
351,LASandy,What a wonderful evening. I would have preferred the crab without all the shrimp and ham in my corn. I  feel crab is delicious enough not to fuss with it as much as you do. The tomato heirloom salad was magnificent. Thank you for a lovely evening.,5,4,5,5
352,BobZ,"Food was magnificent, surpassed only by Will's attentive but not intrusive service.",5,5,5,5
353,OpenTable Diner,Delicious oysters and soft shell crab. Chef JG is fabulous!,5,5,5,5

355,OpenTable Diner,Outstanding meal.  Definitely plan to return sometime in The future.,5,5,5,5
356,Didi74,Went early so noise level was managable. Best fried clams to be found inland!,5,5,5,3
357,joans,"Expensive, but seafood is. This is top quality.
Plan to park on the street.",5,4,5,5
358,Jape,"Family birthday celebration with kids aged 5 and 7. First off, the food was DELICIOUS. The seafood was delicately cooked and seasoned perfectly, with great flavour pairings. Even the kids‚Äô fish sticks were Devine (though maybe too devine for them, since they barely ate them!). The service was attentive and nice to us as a family. We didn‚Äôt feel unwelcome at all.

Two things could have made it better. 1 - they add a credit card fee, framed as a cash discount. I found this to be outdated and added unnecessary and unexpected cost to the bill. Who does this now?? Almost enough to put us off returning. 2 - they gave us bespoke menus for the birthday, which was a nice touch. I asked for a cake or at least a candle in the dessert. We got nothing, so I had an awkward conversation with my wife on the way home! 

Overall, though, the quality of the food makes me recommend it. They just need to get with the times and get rid of the credit card charge",4,5,4,4
359,SteveN,"Been coming here for several years, always a delicious meal.  And if you want a good wine selection, talk to JJ.  He has never steered us wrong.",5,5,5,5

363,AnaS,We were celebrating my birthday. Will was our server and made the experience wonderful..,5,5,5,5
364,ArezouG,"I had dined at Black Salt many times before but I noticed how overpriced everything had become. One person in our party asked for something other than fish and they offered ribeye. It was a very average cut, but charged $79 for it when the check arrived. With 10% DC food tax and 25% tip, one meal alone came to be $107!!! Way too overpriced and nothing at all special about anything. Service was excellent but again considering everything, $600 for dinner for 4 people????
Will never ever go back there again.",3,4,4,2
365,SJLDW,"We loved the food and service overall. The downside was that I would have preferred the option of having one crab cake instead of two. As a tourist, it wasn‚Äôt feasible to request a box for the leftovers. At $60, I also wasn‚Äôt willing not to complete my meal. Otherwise, great place, and we‚Äôll definitely return if we travel to NYC again. However, I probably won‚Äôt order the crab cakes.",4,5,5,5

369,ESUS,"Lovely neighborhood restaurant that has been solid since it opened years ago. The service was helpful and courteous - I requested a quiet booth but was not given one upon arrival. The maitress d' accommodated us (altho it took longer than it should have). The calamari was a standout - very tender and crunchy - and a large portion. My seared tuna was perfectly cooked but note it is served with a heavy sauce. Table service was a little rough (forks forgotten, elbows in my face) but cheerful and well-meaning.",4,4,4,3

371,BillyT,"What can we say. Since our first visit in 2017 this our go to seafood restaurant.

In all a true gem and a must for foodies.",5,5,5,5

374,CFroe,We return over and over again to Blacksalt because of the quality of the experience.  The food and service are consistently fantastic.  We love the oysters and the fish is prepared in the most creative and delicious ways without being pretentious.  We also love the after dinner drink menu.  Blacksalt is wonderful!!,5,5,5,4

376,AHD1,We had a very nice meal.  Our appetizer of hummus and condiments was excellent.  The fish tacos were really delicious and I would order them again.  My guest loved the flourless chocolate cake.  The ambience is very pleasant too.  The weak part of the experience was the service.  Our server acted like she was working at a diner.  The service did not match the quality of the food.,4,4,2,5

Soft shells and Lump crab cakes were amazing. Red snapper was fresh, cooked perfectly and creatively

Only drawback - Small room, noisy at times.",5,5,5,4
379,Historyteacher,"Our party of three enjoyed the Ipswich clams and calamari as appetizers.  We enjoyed our cocktails; Parasol and the whiskey based one (sorry forgot its‚Äô name).  Our entrees; crab cake, halibut, and dover sole all incredibly delicious and cooked to our various requests.  The sole was expertly filleted at the table by our delightful waiter.  We enjoyed the Spanish white (Alberino?) wine to accompany the main meal.  We ordered the pavlova, banana tart, and berry parfait all three of which were delicious.
While we don‚Äôt come here frequently for lunch (always a special treat), we are never disappointed when we can visit.",5,5,5,5

Love this place, this food and this level of service!",5,5,5,5

388,JuliaK,"One of the best meals of my life. My party of three got hackelback caviar, hamachi tartare, and lobster gyoza as starters. The hamachi tartare was especially good, but all three were quite memorable. For entrees we got crab cakes, halibut, and the seafood stew. They were all magnificent, but I think the crab cakes stood out the most. I usually don‚Äôt order them because most places use too much cake and not enough crab, but these were crab-centric and amazing. For desert we got the key lime pie, tropical ricotta cheesecake, and chocolate torte. The key lime pie was my favorite. The bartender also invented a mocktail for me. I said I like fruit and spicy drinks and he gave me an amazing mixture of lime juice, ginger, chili, and mint. LOVED it.",5,5,5,5

We had the seafood tower, ahi tuna, branzino and halibut. No complaints whatsoever - everything was delicious. The wine list has a terrific selection of wines. The service was elegant l, competent and friendly. It had been a few years since BCE we dined at Black Salt and now we can‚Äôt wait to return. Cheers!!!",5,5,5,5
392,DCfoodie,"Seafood seafood seafood! For the first time we did not get the seafood tower.  We thought we owed the rest of the menu a look. There's a yummy Spanish seafood stew, a luscious appetizer with shrimp and crabmeat and avocado and other delights put together like a trifle, a variety of delicious oysters, and a healthy salad of grain and lettuce and fava beans. Last night we ate in the quiet dining room. It was full of people eating and talking but you could hear your table mates as if you had the room to yourselves. The wait staff are knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. It was another great evening.",5,5,5,5

Nobody could agree on who ordered the best thing - everything was delicious, impeccably presented, and just beautifully prepared. Our server was very friendly and efficient, and the atmosphere on a Friday night - busy, bustling but never noisy - was lovely (the booths in the back half of the restaurant are comfortable, cosy and quiet. We'll be back, again and again.",5,5,5,5
394,none,Great place for a birthday. Apps were large portions so we couldn't make it to order dessert.,5,5,5,4

396,AllanM,"Still among the very best, if not the best, seafood restaurants in the city.",5,5,5,4

398,BethesdaDiner,"Excellent food, Excellent Service. A bit too noisy indoors. Would surely visit again.",5,5,5,5
399,BrianS,Great food and great service.  Looking forward to going there again.,5,5,5,5

403,mabelm,Great branch and my wife spent there a great mothers day. Quality and service as great as pre pandemic. Somethind not common nowaday.,5,5,5,5
404,BillyT,"Our go to seafood restaurant. Based upon the food quality and creativity this should be a Michelin starred restaurant. Over quality of the food, creativity of dishes, consistency of never having had a bad meal, makes this one of DC‚Äôs must go to restaurants.",5,5,5,5
405,SeniorFoody,Great food. Accommodating and professional staff.  Used vacuum cleaner and irons in dining room with guests present which is rude beyond woods.,5,5,5,4
406,OpenTable Diner,"The food and service were sensational, as always.  The pricing is abnormally high, even for a nice restaurant.  It's a special occasion type of place and a treat, but I would not call it a neighborhood gem.",5,5,5,5
407,RichardM,Excellent seafood. Excellent wine selection. Wonderful service. A class act all the way,5,5,5,4
408,AndrewK,"Service fabulous.
Was able to custom order a salmon filet not on the menu.",5,5,5,5
409,FB0037Foodie,"This was a truly great experience. Mostly because of how it was handled. After an hour after being seated we had to ask where our appetizers were, because others had received theirs. Our server, Tom, and the manager, JJ, both apologized and took complete ownership of the error, where others might have sought to divert blame. They not only comped the bill, but repeatedly apologized for the mistake. That they were honest and admitted the mistake was appreciated. My husband and I know things happen and don‚Äôt hold blame, and will be glad to return.",5,5,5,4
410,Susan,"I hesitate to write this review only because I love BlackSalt's food and service so much and reservations are increasingly competitive. The food is always fresh and beautifully presented, with an amazing balance of tastes, textures and food categories. We go there for eating in our neighborhood and also for special occassions, which they do beautifully without making an overly embarrassing fuss. Service is impeccible and recommendations are tailored to the individual's tastes, not their daily specials. It is world-class outstanding.",5,5,5,5
411,OpenTable Diner,I love it! I go all the time for any occasion. The service and food are always the best every time I go.,5,5,5,5

415,Meltedcheese,"The food was very good.  The service was OK.  They forgot to bring us bread, and the rest of the service was OK.

The food was great.  We had 6 west coast oysters to start and they were great.  I had the halibut and my spouse had the crab cake.  We shared the dark chocolate cake dessert.

If the service had been a little better, they would have scored a five.",4,5,3,3
416,bailey,Raw oysters and seared scallops were our favorites.  One can always rely on a great meal here.,5,5,5,5
417,KimM,"Great food, attentive staff, and excellent atmosphere!",5,5,5,5
418,RaGs,"There is nothing bad I will say about Black Salt.  The food was good (not outstanding), service was very good.  I have had the same foods at other places which were much better and for either the same price or less.

Simply there is nothing wrong with the restaurant but it did not leave me wanting to go back.",3,3,4,4
419,PaulK,"What can I say? This was probably one of the finest, if not thee finest, dining experiences I've ever had. The friends...lovely.  The food...outstanding. The service...impeccable. The BlackSalt staff made my wife's birthday celebration something special, and I cannot thank them more. Whether it's for a casual dinner or a special occasion, go to BlackSalt. You'll not be disappointed with the choice.",5,5,5,5
420,OpenTable Diner,"Blacksalt had a rare off day. We each revisited dishes we had on previous visits. Our favorite, the clam chowder, was nearly flavorless. There were also issues with the halibut‚Äôs flavor, though it was crispy and perfectly cooked. The service was good and all the staff were friendly. We will go there again but hope that the next meal will be more consistent with our previous visits.",3,2,5,4
421,Janet,"Our server Donee and other staff members were excellent.  My main dish (seabass) had a bit too much olive taste for my palate, but I loved the appetizer (seasonal salad) and dessert (chocolate-peanut butter creation).  My dinner companions love their meals.  It was my birthday, and a nice little chocolate mousse w/candle was presented, along with a copy of the menu to commemorate the evening.  We'll be back.",4,4,5,5

429,OpenTable Diner,"Great food and excellent service.   Fresh seafood is the specialty. Atmosphere is nice,  very  classy.    Unfortunately, as is so often the case nowadays, many / most of the diners were rather shabbily dressed.  On a Saturday evening no less!  Come on, people!
Had to ding the restaurant a little bit because the prices are quite high.  But a great experience nonetheless.",4,5,5,4
430,Partridgepeg,"Best oysters on the half-shell for selection, freshness, shucking, and presentation -- nuff said.",4,5,5,4
431,local,"We had a great meal! Service was attentive and food was great.  We have not been to Blacksalt for full dinner for ages and it was a treat, our Boston foodie relatives also enjoyed their meal (including the Dover sole) very much. The scallop starter, which my husband and I split, was outstanding. And the dinner version of Addies mussels was great.",5,5,5,5

438,OpenTable Diner,"Outstanding!  Great ambience, food and service were great.  Get the mushroom soup and the cheesecake was terrific.",5,5,5,5
439,CatherineB,Outstanding service.  Raw oysters were sweet and Rhode Island calamari divine.  Red snapper was best ever!,5,5,5,5
440,FoodForThought,"Quality of food was good, but price points on some items were inconsistent with other seafood dining experiences.  Additionally, I'd highly recommend kids under 10 not join your party.  Food selection for kids under 10 was dismal.  No French Fries! That's a classic menu item for kids.",2,2,2,2

445,rick,"some of the freshest seafood in DC.  Preparations are near perfect and the kitchen accommodates customer requests for preparation of the food.  Few places will do that.

447,StaceyC,"Lovely meal in the back dining room. Service was excellent! We started with the soft shell crabs-- which are now in season -- they were cooked to perfection. Two of us had the seafood stew which was absolutely delicious, and the other had the snapper which she loved as well. The Pavlova and peanut butter chocolate desserts did not disappoint. We were easily able to hear each other talk and had a wonderful experience all in all.",5,5,5,5
448,Monica,"Chris did an outstanding job of helping to manage the reservation for our important  dinner.   The ambience is perfect for various semi-intimate occasions with the ""back room"" area.

Cheers.",5,5,5,5

450,LLV2,This is a neighborhood place and only works if you can walk there.  Construction and removal of much of the street parking along with zone restrictions make it virtually impossible to find parking in the palisades neighborhood.  Always lives this place for the great seafood but I won‚Äôt be back again after years of being a patron.,1,4,5,4

453,Mike,"The food was superb, as always. Our waiter, however, left a lot to be desired. Borderline rude and not attentive at all. Basic stuff like filling a water glass was a challenge.",3,5,2,3
454,DCfoodie,"Service was excellent. Sat between the bar and near the kitchen, so it was loud, the main dining area seemed much quieter. The food was so/so. The snapper was slightly overdone a the entrees took awhile to come out. Overall, it‚Äôs a good seafood place, just pricey for what the final quality you get.",4,3,5,3
455,Isafoodenthusiast,"I went to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday and it could not have been a better experience. The attention to details, the kindness of the staff and exceptional food made the evening a superlative experience. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!",5,5,5,5

458,localfooide,"The staff at Black Salt could not have been more generous. We preordered Shad Roe and boy oh boy did the kitchen staff deliver.  We started with Oysters Rockefeller, the Shad Roe served over a bed of wonderful spring veggies, and completed the meal with dessert (choc peanut butter torte and key lime pie).  I stopped at the kitchen on the way out and said to the chef, ""do I have you to thank for the wonderful Shad Roe?""  And he replied, ""no, it was the staff.""  And he waved/pointed to the line cooks.  I thanked them all for the wonderful food and service.  They truly touched my heart.  I can't wait to go back.",5,5,5,5
459,MAZ123,"Great ambience and my salad was excellent, but my $52 tuna entree was a big disappointment.  The portion was very small, there was no vegetable, and 4 of the 6 small tuna pieces were gristly and inedible.",2,2,5,5

465,OpenTable Diner,"The food and wine were outstanding. We got the branzino, oysters rockefeller, clam chowder, and ahi tuna. Desserts were also excellent. The only qualm I had was that the prices were a bit above average.",4,4,5,5
466,HusseinD,"Disappointing dinner and not one I would encourage you unless you want a drink and some overpriced fish in the neighborhood.

We were 4 and very hungry at dinner.

Crab cakes were good as they should be at $60. Poke was good. Calamari adequate - you generally cannot go wrong with fried calamari. However lobster dumpling was ""horrible"" as was the chicken and vegetable soup. One tase and it was left untouched by the guest. I have not been there in 10 years and was disappointed by the food. The Restaurant is resting on its laurels or just a bad night?",3,3,4,4
467,Dinner42,"Always a great time at the consistently fine Black Salt. Servers are perfectly attentive, and the folks in the kitchen know what they‚Äôre doing around all manner of sea creatures. A neighborhood gem, but a destination for folks from near and far. The bar‚Äôs a hit too. Just a convivial place; a pleasure to visit.",5,5,5,5
468,Woodroad,"The back room was so noisy that it was impossible to carry on a conversation. We‚Äôd asked for a quite table, but it was the opposite. While the food and service were good, we won‚Äôt dine at Black Salt again because of the noise.",3,4,4,1

486,Sztravels,"Wonderful food, attentive and helpful service, good cocktails, recently refreshed wine list.  Our favourite seafood restaurant.  Inflation has raised some prices, so it is a special treat rather than a casual anytime place, but we think it is worth it.",5,5,5,5

508,LunchGuest,"Celebrating my mothers 87th Birthday and we had an incredible meal.  She had celebrated another birthday there many before Covid and she loves Sea Food so we decided to return for lunch with less of a crowd.

Only disappointment was that they did not remember to wish her a Happy Birthday.  Maybe post covid it's only done for dinner but I had requested their best table and told them it was her birthday since we have gone on multiple family birthday's and had menu's with the name and even a complimentary dessert.  We ordered a couple on our own for the four of us to share so it was not that we did not enjoy our choices.

Will still return because the food and service was amazing but with such a big mile stone I think a Happy Birthday wish is not much to ask.",5,5,5,4

518,DiceK,"In a very relaxed atmosphere, we enjoyed seafood that was optimally prepared by a chef who knows the characteristics of seafood. As other diners have noted, the crab cakes, which tend to be overdone, were very delicately seasoned and paired wonderfully with the sauces.

523,AlysonR,Outstanding,5,5,5,5
524,JackieB,The food and service are very good but the prices are way too high for a neighborhood restaurant.  We eat at a Michelin star restaurant in DC for less. 50 - 60 plus dollar entrees with 30 dollar appetizers seem very high.  We love Blacks but not at these prices. Love the bar and will continue to go for drinks unless the pricing gets under control and back to what it was.,4,4,5,5

Lovely textures and seasonal flavors in all dishes from oysters to key lime pie! The large service platter for our small serving of 6 oysters seemed inappropriate. The aroma of fish in the front market could be less. We dined in the wine room which was more quiet and less fishy. The bathrooms could have been cleaner. Overall it was a lovely dining experience and we will return!",5,4,5,4

542,BillyT,Consistency is not always found in restaurants. We used to patronize Black Salt 2-3 times a week pre pandemic.  We became pregnant and our son was born and so dinning out was placed on hold.  Last night was our first visit in a year and to say it was great is an under statement. Food as we remembered. Consistent with taste and quality we remember. Quality is the best. Service top notch. Couldn‚Äôt ask for a better home coming.,5,5,5,4
543,OpenTable Diner,"My husband and I enjoyed the food, atmosphere and service.  It was our first time eating at BlackSalt, and will not be our last.",5,5,5,5
544,BruceS,A wonderful meal.  Service was especially excellent.,5,5,5,4
545,Sheri,Casual dinner with longtime friends. We were a bit shocked to see the price of the two special entrees for that evening at $49. Seemed a bit high for the ‚Äúspecials‚Äù but the food quality and preparation is top notch.,5,5,5,4
546,PascalS,Excellent dinner: we had the halibut and tuna. Delicious. And the seafood comes from the shop inside the restaurant.,5,5,5,5
547,NorlS,"From the smell of the sea when you first open the door, to the final taste of the provencal fish stew, a feast for all the senses.",5,5,5,5
548,NickO,Great food. Great service. Nice crowd. All good. Parking not super easy. But we recommend big time.,5,5,5,5
549,HanoverHR,"Overall, a good experience.  I took my friend and her son out for my friend's birthday.  The staff was friendly, however, a little forgetful.  They missed bringing an ordered drink, and they kept trying to pour wine in my glass after I told them I did not want anymore (driving).  Those are small things, though.  The real issue was my primary entree.  I paid $70+ for a steak that was little more than a think cut rib-eye you would typically find at Food Lion.  I was very surprised.  Although the meat was well prepared and tasted great - the quality of the cut was sub-par for the price.  I would have given a lower rating, however, the appetizers (squid and calamari) were great and exceptionally well done.  

Overall, a bit of a conflict on entrees v. appetizers, making this a difficult review.  

The ambience was fine -- not too loud, but tables were situated such that there was a bit of competition in regards to conversations around us and wait staff coming to and fro.  

Being able to view the kitchen as the meals are prepared was a nice touch, and not common.  The kitchen was separated from the dining room by sliding glass doors -- so prep was visible (and interesting) while not being loud and distracting (i.e. you could ignore it if you wanted to).

Wine selection was nice and after dinner cappuccino was well done.

Overall 4 stars, largely because of the sub par quality of the steak.",4,3,4,5
550,Buckie,Wait staff gave suggestions for what to order. Food came quickly. And was delicious.,5,5,5,5

556,LJFoodie,"We had an excellent anniversary celebration meal. The fried clams were perfectly cooked, and we both enjoyed the day boat scallop appetizer, and our two entrees (crab cake and ahi tuna) were excellent. Service was attentive without being intrusive. While a bit expensive, it is in line with what you'd expect at a top of the line seafood restaurant. Worth a repeat visit!",5,5,5,4
557,JamesandLisafromKY,"We chose Black Salt at random due to its location and could not be happier. Our friends from Michigan, New Jersey and Kentucky gathered for a lovely dinner with great service and excellent food. We were welcomed and appreciated the personalized menus we were given - a great touch. But, as always, it is about the food - the food was WONDERFUL!!!",5,5,5,5

563,OpenTable Diner,Amazing food and service. Hands down best seafood in DC.,5,5,5,5
564,Partridgepeg,"Each of our visits to Black Salt starts with oysters on the half shell, and this one was no exception.  Black Salt's oyster menu is not only extensive, but offers a selection that includes a wide varity of oysters from different areas of the country; and a choice of salinity that satisfies every oyster lover's taste.  But if we were to pick one thing that sets Black Salt's oysters far above anyother purveyors of bivalves in the area it would be the precision of the oyster shuckers.  People who enjoy oysters agree that even the finest oysters can be ruined if the shucker is improperly trained of negligent in his/her work.  This is never a problem at Black Salt.
Of course oysters are not the only delights on Black Salt's menu.  In fact the menu is full of surprises on the first (left side) page of the menu.  Starters are our favorite, and salads, soups and seafood selections offer something new on every visit.
Don't miss the oysters, and while your're there allow Black Salt to give you something new to enjoy.",5,5,5,5
565,DorothyC,Dinner was superb and service was excellent. Main oysters were exceptionally fresh.,5,5,5,5

575,Ava33,"Wonderful first visit. Very diligent staff always attentive. Chowder was substantial and good portion for price. Crab cake sandwich was decently sized, not huge, but quality. Only minor suggestion is to cut back on salt on the potato chips. With everything else having salt, it was too much. Salad with warm / baked fig was also healthy and great to split.",5,4,5,5

591,JPTo,"Fresh and really nicely prepared seafood, the seafood tower was a meal for two in itself. Fantastic drinks and deserts, with multiple options (something I'm seeing less of these days). neighborhood type atmosphere.

Thank goodness the food quality and experience is still great.",4,5,5,5
599,AmberH,"A dining experience that did not feel stuffy or overdone. The staff are true professionals and place care in their craft. The kitchen is partially open and you could see the comraderie and clean processes. We had the buttered lobster, branzino filet and shrimp cocktail. All delicious but the standout was the shrimp cocktail (homeade tortilla chips!) Located in a cutesy neighborhood, we will be back when visiting DC. Thank you, BlackSalt!",5,5,5,4
600,OpenTable Diner,Come here for dinner before going to The Kennedy Center to see Hamilton. The food and service were absolutely amazing!!

612,KurtE,"Wow! Our first time here, having dined at 2 other Black Salt group restaurants. This flagship location was by far the best! We were here to celebrate a birthday, and the entire experience was fantastic from the moment we arrived. We were seated in a booth which was ideal to allow for ease of conversation without feeling like we were having to raise our voices. Though the noise level was low last night. 
The oysters were delicious! However I definitely want to try some of their caviar on our next visit. They have an extensive selection. Our waiter was nice and attentive, and and offered some great suggestions, all of which were spot on! 
Our entrees were perfectly prepared and outstanding. As were the cocktails and desserts. 
Definitely planning on returning soon.",4,5,4,4

615,Alice,We had a fantastic evening at Black Salt. The food and the service are the highlights. The staff were warm and welcoming. They allowed me to pick between a booth and the wine room when I called in advance regarding one of my guests being hearing impaired. I picked the wine room but then my guest said it was too cold so we moved back to the booth and it was plenty quiet. The staff did not get flustered by our moving tables. The waitress was very attentive. The food was delicious. The menu includes really interesting food pairings. The portions are generous (and the left overs the next day were great). I will definitely be back.,5,5,4,3

618,PgSmile,"Black Salt has lost something. This has been my fav DC restaurant for a decade. But the last four visits just have not measured up. The dishes have gotten murky and messy where they used to be crisp and defined. 

And our server this evening was from another planet. Almost tossing dishes down on the table. Really odd. 

We want the old Black Salt back.",4,3,1,3

633,glover,"Friend and I went for lunch during the week.   It was very very quiet.   Maybe just another table or two.   Lots of booth sitting so that made the space even more comfortable, quiet, cozy.   We had great friendly and efficient service.   Fish tacos were delicious, but awkward to eat.   The scallop appetizer with some crispy greens and Brussel sprouts was fabulous.    Good thing we went for lunch,  because we noticed that all the listed entrees are over $40! wow.",5,5,5,5
634,AviA,We had the worst service experience . Our waiter Dan was rushing us to get through our meals  and he smelled like cigarette smoke when he delivered our Desserts. Great food but not the best waiter.,4,5,3,5

636,Ryan,"The only complaint, and it is very minor, is that they have a much smaller wine list  than most high-end restaurants to which we have been.  The manager/sommelier was very accommodating and helped us try a french wine that was good but not great for the price point.  The service was outstanding though, and the food was also excellent.",5,5,5,5

I truly enjoyed the atmosphere.  It was National Caviar Day and I had caviar.  The management was friendly.  My waiter was knowledgeable too.   

I will definitely visit again soon.",5,5,5,4
644,GChristy,"This was without the worse dining experience I‚Äôve had ANYWHERE in the world. The Cole slaw was so salty and overwhelmed by creole mustard it was inedible. The crab cakes at 31$ each came barely warm on a dry, cold bun. The crab cakes was paltry in size and was not made with lump crab and extremely bland. Service was ok but rather inattentive. In years past this was a delightful restaurant. Now it is an extremely overpriced mess with local neighborhood diners who clearly have more money than taste.  If you don‚Äôt know good quality seafood and don‚Äôt mind wasting money on inedible food this is your place to dine.",1,1,2,2
645,AmyJ,"Too expensive
Smelled fishy",3,3,3,3

647,JCDC,"Came in to celebrate our anniversary.   Service was great (they even had custom menu‚Äôs for us saying ‚ÄúHappy Anniversary‚Äù).   We really enjoyed house bread and the appetizers, butter poached lobster and the best clam chowder I have ever tasted.  My wife also really liked her halibut. I was not as impressed with the Japanese stew, of which some bites were quite good and others were so full of the shredded ginger to be almost inedible.  Desserts were also very good. 

Service was great and as good or better than you‚Äôd expect from a place at this price point.",4,4,5,3

653,Samoth,Good overall but not outstanding.  Very fresh tuna was overpowered by peanut sauce and mushy noodles. Halibut was also very fresh and flaky but accompanying bed of vegetables and morels were mushy and bland.  Mexican chile corn chowder as a starter was the one standout.  Key lime pie was mediocre.  I have had much better meals at Black Salt in the past and would go back based on those meals.  Maybe this was an off night.,4,4,4,3

657,NativeTribe,"An Oldie but STILL quite Amazing -- BlackSalt remains my favorite place for the freshness oysters (best varietals) in the city. Prior to the pandemic, Sea Catch (permanently closed) and BlackSalt would revival for 1st place in my book. Now, BlackSalt remains lightyears ahead of the competition with top tier fine-dining service (including all the bells and whistle from the hostess, servers, runners, sommelier and management), and maintains consistent high food quality standards. 

My mum and I dined at BlackSalt prior to BlackGirlsRock at the Kennedy Center. Firstly, we ordered the Seafood Tower with additional oysters and a bottle of Sav Blanc. Our excited taste buds allowed us to consume the majority of the delicious components within 10mins; very impressive and unexpected according to our server (LOL). Next, we shared a rib-eye with additional sides and also, the octopus. While the steak was cooked perfectly (med rare), we were full and wanted to be comfortable enough to enjoy the concert so we boxed the steak and had (2) spicy margaritas for dessert. YUM! Thanks again, BlackSalt. Keep up the great work!",5,5,5,4

We sat in the dining room and the temperature felt quite hot and sticky, leaving us pretty uncomfortable for our entire meal.

664,Icio076,Great good; great service.,5,5,5,5

674,carkies,"It is always a favorite for fresh, creative seafood.  The grilled calamari is just amazing and the oysters Rockefeller are the best I have ever had and I am really really old!
It is always a treat and great to pick something up for your next dinner on the way out !",5,5,5,4
675,SallyP,We had a delicious meal at Black Salt.  It was not cheap however.  I will go there again for special occasions but it is too expensive to go to on a regular basis.,4,5,5,5
676,MarcyB,No real lunch menu. No entree salads in 95 degree heat.,3,2,5,4
677,ToddB,"Service & friendliness of staff was great! As well, the food was tasty, especially the red snapper! However, we thought the menu prices were a ‚Äúlittle high‚Äù compared to similar seafood restaurants we‚Äôve eaten at!",5,5,5,4
678,john,"As always, food and service were excellent. Ambience just right.",5,5,5,5
679,Dinner42,"Great lunch! We were five and ate handsomely, at the round table adjacent to the kitchen (which we‚Äôd asked for). An ahi first course and a Japanese fish stew, along with a soft shell sandwich (not on the menu; just ask for anything in the front case; the staff is terribly accommodating!) were standouts. The only miss was the cream of crab soup. Rich but meh. The Alaskan halibut was perfect and perfectly cooked, and the asparagus salad was beautiful and delicious. Ate too much and had to skip dessert. 

We live close by and of course will be back!",4,4,5,4
680,Flowerstone,We have visited several times and have found this to be a consistently outstanding seafood restaurant. Prices are high but then again food served is also.,5,5,5,5
681,ahmimY,Nice place: good food and friendly service.  A bit pricy but it's worth the experience.,4,4,4,3
682,AprilE,"Oysters were great.  Our main dish the Japanese stew was ok.  The shellfish was good.  Broth was too salty and they was like 5 pieces of udon noodles.  They advertised what they had for ice cream and sorbet up front by the host stand. So, when my husband ordered a sorbet from there they said it wasn‚Äôt available for the dining area.  So, we got the angel food cake dessert which was good.  I don‚Äôt think our entree was worth $42.  I still would recommend it, but don‚Äôt get the Japanese seafood stew.",3,3,5,3
683,marlam,Great consistency at Black Salt starting with first greeting. Excellent service and food. Great neighborhood spot.,5,5,5,4
684,Kadmos,Great restaurant. Not so great wine list: only expensive wines and not a single good value wine.,4,4,4,4
685,OpenTable Diner,By far the best meal I had while visiting Washington. Every portion of our meal was fresh and delicious. The staff were excellent and very attentive. I highly recommend.,5,5,5,5

687,Lynne,Love the new menu and quiet back room with tablecloths. Japanese style fish soup was terrific! Will return soon,5,5,5,5
688,LizC,We had a lovely server. I forgot to ask her name. The food was excellent and we had a nice long lunch by combining several appetizer sized pleats and chowder,5,5,5,4
689,an0nym0us,"Food was delicious, and service was excellent. The main dining room can be noisy at dinner time but we came for a late lunch on Monday, which was perfect. Highly recommend: fried calamari, wood grilled calamari, lobster pot pie, halibut, key lime cheesecake, and strawberry/rhubarb angel food cake.",5,5,5,5
690,EllenC,"I found the menu very limiting.  I had a hard time finding something I would like to eat on the menu. I ordered the crabcakes and they were just ok.  The crabcake only had shredded crabmeat, no big chunks of backfin or lump crabmeat.  It also had a lot of filler.  I expected more from a crabcake at a restaurant known for seafood.
My husband did enjoy the lobster pot pie appetizer and he said the bronzino was very good.
Our server was excellent and tried to be accomodating.",3,3,5,3
691,Jonathan,Great place. Good food. They even have sashimi grade fish for sale at the fish market in front of the restaurant.,4,4,5,5

Entrees were wonderful. Neighborhood vide, quit and comfortable with a touch of class all around with exceptional service. Well be coming back!!!",5,5,5,5
695,DonB,"Wonderful experience.  Service was a little slow at first, but once we got started, everything went great. Celebrated my friends birthday. Very nice for the restaurant to print up special menus wishing him a happy birthday.  Everyone raved about the food.  The clam chowder was amazing as were the crab cake sandwiches. Definitely a repeat in our future",5,5,4,5
696,GaryG,I‚Äôve had the server a couple times already and she was good but last night wasn‚Äôt good at all .. we didn‚Äôt see her for 30 mins at a time . And the busboy took our bill at the end because she had given up coming over to our table for over half an hour . Very disappointing ‚Ä¶,3,4,2,3

703,WilliamA,"Incredible production.
Made the reunion with my Son and his GF epic.
The oysters were perfect conflicts of the sweet and the salty.
Our server was informed and thoroughly knew the menu(which was personalized.)
The restaurant was alive,vibrant and maintained that neighborhood vibe.
The bar IQ was outstanding.
PS Did I mention the menu was personalized?",5,5,5,5
704,RickS,"We enjoyed our meal, which included both specials and regular menu items.  The service was exceptional.  Our waiter was attentive and helpful.",5,5,5,4
705,OpenTable Diner,"The oysters were perfection! The grilled calamari was tender and flavorful.  The branzino was the best we‚Äôve ever had.  The table/ambiance was ok- weird lighting and sparse room.  We were in the back, maybe the other room is better? The service was good. We will be back - even just to sit at the bar for the oysters!",5,5,5,4
706,lucyfromboston,We had a great celebration at Black Salt. Everything was exceptional. We will be back!,5,5,5,5

708,RobertB,"Most fantastic halibut and soft shell crab. Our waiter, Doug was an experienced guide who lead us down all of the most amazing paths. Thank you Black Salt and Doug!",5,5,5,5

710,Matty,"Went for Easter brunch. At the last minute , I needed to increase my reservation for a party of 4 to table for 5. The hostess originally told me it wasn‚Äôt possible. When I called back to see if anything had changed, she made a big effort to accommodate my request. Excellent! As always, the food was delicious and service was great.",4,4,5,4
711,PeterT,Food and service still excellent.  Decor showing wear.  Prices high so value for $ an issue particularly given increased number of alternatives.,4,5,5,4
712,foodie65,"The food was excellent! So flavorful without going overboard. Our waitress was very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful‚Äî she recommended the perfect entrees for our group. The only downside is the expensive price tag but it‚Äôs definitely worth experiencing at least once.",5,5,5,5

714,OpenTable Diner,Do not care for the back room; otherwise great! Thank u,5,5,5,3
715,Pacocm,"My favorite part of eating at BlackSalt is that, fresh fish imaginatively cooked and presented notwithstanding, there are some staples that are more than reliable comfort food.  The New England Clam Chowder with whole clams, bacon and a creamy broth should be a de rigueur opener as it is one of the best in this area and sets up the palate to expect marvelous entrees afterward.",5,5,5,5
716,ElenaG,Great service. Great food. Pricey. Restaurant could use a refresh.,5,5,5,3
717,RestaurantRob,"Black Salt was perfect in every way -- the food was awesome, the service was attentive but not intrusive, and the atmosphere was very relaxed. It's a perfect place for a night out or a celebration, or just to enjoy fabulous seafood the way it should be done!",5,5,5,5
718,OpenTable Diner,Food was delicious!,5,5,5,5
719,OpenTable Diner,We were visiting from out of town and this was hands down the best steak and the best service I have ever had. The food was a little $$$$ but definitely worth it. We will be back!,5,5,5,5

722,BillC,Diverse menu but pricey - especially for a Saturday lunch.,4,4,3,3
723,Rachel,"The food and service was superb! We will absolutely be dining here again.
Highly recommend the seafood tower and the lobster pot pie. All of the seasonal specials were outstanding as well, we tried the red snapper with crawfish √©touff√©e, out of this world! Ask for Tom, his descriptions and knowledge of the menu really added to our experience.",5,5,5,5
724,OpenTable Diner,Loved every bite and could not have been happier! The sashimi was the best!!!,5,5,5,5

735,TCeats,"The two of us had a great evening last Friday at Blacksalt.  Along with a couple of cocktails (the chili margarita had some kick and was very good), we tried several different appetizers and a dozen oysters.  The appetizers included: clam chowder, grilled octopus, salmon poke, and a beet/goat cheese/green lentil salad.  All were  very good and the oysters (New Brunswick) were top shelf.  I especially enjoy Blacksalt's mignonette.   While we generally prefer to sit in the main dining area, we were seated in the back dining room.  It was full and had a buzz so we didn't the feel of being in exile.",5,5,5,4
736,Jane,Reliably excellent meals and good wine. Great place for a regular family meal or special occasion. Top notch service and ingredients.,4,5,5,4
737,Gems,Service was slow. Food was just okay - salty actually. For a table of 2 we sat for 3 hours - terrible,2,2,3,3

744,Sandy,"Always great food and the staff were very friendly. However, it is getting very6 pricey.",5,5,5,5

We really enjoyed the evening.",5,5,5,3

Service is unfailingly excellent.  This is my second favorite restaurant in DC and it‚Äôs worth every penny.",5,5,5,4
751,AvaM,"The menu was so good it was hard to make a decision. The oysters were out of this world and i'll definitely get the calamari whenever I go. I didn't necessarily care for the cornmeal on the fish taco, but the salmon was so fresh and GOOOD! It was my son's birthday so he had the key lime pie that was out of this world. Great place to dine, excellent wait staff and good vibes.",5,5,5,5

771,marley,"Feeling that what used to be a nice restaurant has been let to slide recently.  Old tables and chairs, dirty ceilings in the seating area, not very clean atmosphere, noisy.

Excellent quality seafood expertly prepared, with many specials based on what's best. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and never intrusive so we could focus on each other. It was very quiet and relaxed, and service was perfectly timed so we weren't waiting on dishes or drinks. The vaccine mandate gave more peace of mind. There's also a very extensive and wonderful wine list. Well worth the prices.",5,5,5,5

785,OpenTable Diner,Everything quite good except for the crab cakes. At $62 they should be excellent. But they weren‚Äôt. No backfin/lump crabmeat visible. I hesitated recommending to my guest that he order them because of the price but we went ahead expecting something great. Sadly not. Many much better options available from many other restaurants.

813,VVSF,They have a rotating caviar menu. All of the staff were pleasant and they weren‚Äôt short staffed. I can only assume they are treated well during these times.,5,5,5,5
814,AnitaW,"Their Octopus is to die for !  I have a squash and sweet potato soup, that franklyI can not stop thinking about.  Loved the freshness and warmth of this soup. Did not have a lot of salt in it.  Which really brought out the favor. LOL",5,5,5,5

818,DiscerningDiner,The food was superb and the service was inviting. The wine room is the best venue for quiet meal in the location.,4,5,5,5
819,eliza,"We made a late lunch reservation on a Monday. The restaurant had a few tables but the hostess seemed rushed as if it were a Saturday night. We waited to be attended to as she and a manger were both on the phone. It was odd and annoying to not even be acknowledged and to have to wait. One of them should have put their caller on hold. 
We were seated toward the back in a booth which was cozy. The vibe is modern industrial with just enough wood tones to keep it from feeling cold. There is a limited view of the kitchen (which I don‚Äôt always love) but the design of it was cool: enough to see activity but not completely visible. 
Our waiter seemed bored or tired or just not that interested and I don‚Äôt think it was intentional but if you‚Äôre not a bubbly person who‚Äôs always ‚Äòon‚Äô, diners in this area receive that as rude. Other service staff was attentive.
I ordered a shrimp bisque which was so good with perfectly balanced flavors and the crab cake entree which was a grave disappointment. The crab was shredded-not chunky-and mushy in texture. It was saut√©ed in a skillet and browned on one side (this was more like a salmon cake in preparation to me). The accompanying sweet potato melange was yummy and I wish the Tartar type sauce was generously placed on a dish for dipping instead of as a decorative swirl on the plate. It was amazing and make the crab cake edible. I‚Äôm a crab cake snob and these were not worth the hefty price tag. They had a crab cake sandwich on the menu as well and I think this crab cake is much better suited to go between two buns; the bread and lettuce would help to offset the sogginess. 
That said, I will return because I‚Äôm sure there are some dishes they do really well and will be as pleasing as the soup.",3,3,2,4
820,ScienceEd,Always reliable for terrific food and especially the service.  I love walking through the fish market to get seated.,5,5,5,4
821,OpenTable Diner,"I went with my husband and son for my birthday.   The servers were all very friendly and the the services was excellent.   Food was good as always, wish is why we selected Black Salt.   It wasn‚Äôt busy because it was just prior to Christmas.  But we have been there when it‚Äôs busy and the service and food was good then too.",5,5,5,5
822,JerriH,"Absoluately delicious as usual!  Fresh and creative - the Red Snapper was outstanding!!  We had friends in town from Dallas who are in the restaurant biz and they LOVED everything.

831,LauraH,"Good experience overall. Food, service and atmosphere were excellent. Expensive",4,4,4,4
832,Alexandria,"The food was very good-too pricey for what it was-two crab cakes were $62.00.  They were delicious-but Not worth $12.50 bite and not ‚ÄúOh my Michelin Stars these are the best crab cakes In the world‚Äù delicious.  A martini at $16.00 also seems excessive, but it was also delicious.  We were seated in the back which is very quiet and contemporary-has a suburban vibe-a contrasting offering to the edgy/arty/noisy front dining room. The street parking behind the restaurant is pitch dark.",4,5,5,4
833,JanD,"Excellent, interesting menu. Nice presentation. Clam chowder was out of this world. Very attentive service and timing of courses was well done.",5,5,5,5
834,OpenTable Diner,"I am a frequent guest at black-salt. Last night was an off night for the kitchen, everything was very very salty and the service, usually impeccable, even during the pandemic, was slow. I will always return just wanted to share in the spirit of hoping for an amazing experience everytime.",3,2,2,3
835,OpenTable Diner,"Customer service at its best. This place has it all. Amazing food, great atmosphere, attention to detail, clean and cozy. My wife loves this place. I made a reservation for her birthday. The restaurant printed out a special menu with the date and a line saying ""happy birthday""  for our table ..  Customized menus for us. How special is that???
After COVID many restaurants lost customer service , attention to detail. It seems like most restaurants are running short staff and it shows on the service level. NOT BLACKSALT
This place has it together. 
Another example. When they brought our food, the ladies on the table get their plate 1st , then everyone else after. We noticed those details. That's why they deserve 5 starts . Simply put, quality with taste. 
I highly recommend it . Plus the food is amazing.",5,5,5,5
836,JeffK,Very high quality food. Good service. You pay for what you get - it is expensive.,4,4,4,4
837,RuslanC,"Unfortunately the dinner was ruined, we counted two bottles of wine instead of one at final bill and we might not have noticed and paid the extra hundred dollars. We did not hear an apology or a compliment from the chef, we just received a new bill.  Be careful and watch your score.  By the way, everything was delicious.",3,5,3,3
838,PhilP,"First time visiting. LOVE the place. Free parking and other nearby relatively cheap parking nearby. Ambience was just right perfect (we were seated in the wine room). Service was attentive but not intrusive. The menu was comprehensive and not overwhelming. Plating was simple and attractive. Taste profiles were well balanced without any ingredient spiking. We had the Gruner Vetliner, which was decently priced and perfect matched to our table's choices. This was an unpretentious, Goldilock's experience. Prices were reasonable for the experience. Will return.",5,5,5,5

I am vegan, so no entrees on the menu are plant based, but our waiter offered they could make a veggie plate for me, which was absolutely the best and delicious!! Salads were fresh and perfectly dressed. The flourless chocolate cake was amazing, too. 
Would definitely recommend this gem!",5,5,5,5

879,Foodieintheburbs,"The food here is absolutely delicious but low key atmosphere and decor.  High end dining prices without high end dining experience with a fish store at the entrance.

881,OpenTable Diner,"Food, drinks and service was great. Will return very soon.",5,5,5,4
882,Cmoney,Food  was  decent.  Server was very attentive. Drinks were  good.  Crabcakes were so so. I should know by now (as a crabcake snob)  to never  try crabcakes  outside of the  Baltimore  area.  Similar to the way  you should never  try cheesesteaks outside of  Philly area.,4,3,5,4
883,Mexicogood,Seafood was excellent as always!  Gracious service and we were in an awkward location so servers had to come from different directions.,5,5,5,4
884,DEBJ,Love BlackSalt!,5,5,5,4
885,BryanN,"One of the best meals I have ever enjoyed. I had the clam chowder and crab cakes, both FANTASTIC.  Even the dessert was top-notch. Great service and even with their scaled-back menu it is one of the best places in town.",5,5,5,5
886,TraciH,The food was fantastically delicious. Service was good.  Ambiance could have been better if I was sat further away from the kitchen. My biggest regret is I went late so I felt a bit rushed. The lights started going off and I was not ready to leave. Overall a great experience and I will return on my next trip to DC. I'll make sure to go much earlier.,4,5,4,3
887,Partridgepeg,"As always BlackSalt has the best selection of oysters, and the most efficient shuckers  in the metro area.  The fish market that surrounds the entrance is certain to brighten  any seafood lover's day, and help customers decide ""what's for lunch"".  Like everyone should be we make every attempt to stay safe no matter where we go, and it is good to see that our old friends at BlackSalt are doing everything they can to help in that respect.  Indeed a very enjoyable Sunday lunch in the best seafood house in the DC area.",4,4,5,3

889,JamesP,"Food and services was very good, but the wine list, which is limited, is over-priced to an extent that boarders on offensive. I don't mind paying twice the retail price but three times is ridiculous",3,4,4,4
890,JenniferL,"Black Salt is a great option for a nice dinner or celebration. The cocktails are amazing, the food is delicious and the service is attentive. The menu offers innovative seasonal dishes as well as favorites like the crab cake sandwich.

892,PhilipJ,The crab cake I ordered seemed highly breaded ‚Äî not many larger chunks of crab ‚Äî tasted frozen. Overpriced!,3,3,3,3
893,Gooseman53,"Went for our anniversary.  Staff welcomed us with a menu recognizing our special day.  Waiter was very personable and doting.  Like most places Blacksalt is struggling to staff up so the service was a bit slow.  Food and beverage quality was outstanding.  Blacksalt always has the best fish in the area.  Their fried Ipswich clams are as good as you will find in New England.  Our entrees were perfectly prepared and delicious.  The emphasis is on the fish, to bring out its best and present it without gimmickry.  

The food, service and ambience made it a lovely, memorable evening.",5,5,5,5

896,OpenTable Diner,"I was pretty disappointed in the experience. It felt a little dated and pretentious. The food was overpriced and nothing special. The service was good, as in plates were removed promptly but our server had a pompous attitude and both my husband and I felt that we weren‚Äôt treated the same as he treated his very special customers at the table next to us.",2,3,3,2
897,MargoH,"always a great meal at Blacksalt.  We were celebrating our anniversary, and they had a special menu printed up for us (and gave us a copy when we left).  Attentive servers, and the food was delicious as always.",5,5,5,5

901,PhilC,"First time at Black Salt.  The staff was very nice and the food was good.  We didn't experience the more sophisticated fare, but what we ate was very good.

903,OpenTable Diner,"We had a very nice time. Food and service were terrific. A special thanks to the staff for the awesome recognition of my brother-in-law within the menu. That was a special touch and a memorable moment on his birthday. He loved the birthday cupcake and candle, too. 

Many thanks!!!",4,4,4,4
904,KimO,BlackSalt is fabulous.  Food and service are exceptional. From fantastic oysters Rockefeller and crab cakes to delicious herb crusted halibut. Completely delicious and delightful.

Everyone that you encounter, from host stand to server has absolute knowledge of all the menu items. The bar scene was perhaps more lively before Covid‚Ä¶well, much more lively, but you are still likely to bend an elbow with learned and interesting denizens here.
The food quality and service has never flagged. Can you tell I love BlackSalt? Happy hour is not the only time I dine there, but it‚Äôs a fine value and one has the chance to sample more items than in a typical dinner.",5,5,5,4

931,TerrenceH,"Black Salt is an excellent restaurant. The sommelier was helpful, the woman who explained the cheese plate was as well. The erosive was good except they brought the wrong meal for my wife, but recovered fairly well. My opinion is the server we had was a little too busy to provide the same level of service everyone else did. About two thirds of the way through or meal a large group came into our room and was so noisy it was hard to talk at our table. I would have expected that in the larger dining area, but not in the back. 
We will definitely return and hope for a quieter set of diners to be present. The food was truly outstanding.",4,5,4,5

934,Newbin,"The service, food, drink, and ambiance were outstanding. What else is there except for the wonderfully robust local oysters and their specials. I particularly enjoyed the salmon which was light and flaked. The halibut was also prepared to perfection and consistent with the incredible service.",5,5,5,5
935,OpenTable Diner,"Likely due to Pandemic, but very long wait between appetizers and entrees.  Long wait discouraged us from ordering dessert.  Server was nice but did not seem well informed about the menu.  One of our party did not eat seafood and only options were a cheeseburger and salad.  Restaurant used to serve a very good steak, but they explained they simplified the menu because of COVID and no longer offered it.",4,5,3,4

Also, the waiter, even though very experience, seemed to want to rush us into making our choices.  We weren't taking too long and wanted to enjoy catching up with our friends who joined us.  There was space in the restaurant for others.  Still the food and ambiance will keep us coming there.",4,4,3,4
960,OpenTable Diner,"We catching up after a number of years, so it was blissfully quiet, the wait staff was great allowing Us all the time we needed. The server even brought written information about connecting & pass word, so accommodating.
It was an excellent menu, lots of diversity one had the apricot salad with crispy Italian ham, which was heavenly,& grilled octopus for the other, outstanding.",5,4,5,5

We both had a variety of oysters followed by mussels for me and octopus for my wife.
The oysters were perfectly shucked as always and the mussels and octopus were prepared  just right.
A very nice lunch indeed.",5,5,5,4
968,None,Super quality seafood spoiled by unrefined cooking. Plenty of service people but quality of service is like in a simple chain restaurant. Tables not cleaned well so they are sticky. Tableware needs to come wrapped. Social distancing needs to be applied. Price exceptional high for what you get. Food must be more refined. Pilling together good stuff does not make food better.,3,2,3,2

975,ValeriaL,"Everything was wonderful! 
I wanted to invite my father to a dinner date and BlackSalt was the perfect place.",5,5,5,5
976,Sallie,"Unfortunately, the potato chips were stale.  The fried clams were not as fresh tasting as in the past (pre-Covid) nor did they feature any clam bellies....only strips.  Finally, the topping on the Oysters Rockefeller was delicious but the oysters were sandy and chewy.

We love Black Salt.  Maybe it was just a bad day (lunch mid-week).  Will try again.",2,2,2,4
977,ElizabethL,Great service and food (the scallop appetizer was terrific).,5,5,5,5
978,Brad,"We were in the back room.  Wait staff was superb.  Food was great.  Prices much higher in past, at least in our memory.  Still, we were happy.",5,5,5,4
979,LadyBrit,"Excellent as usual in all categories - the chef and all the staff provide a memorable experience - expensive, but worth it.",5,5,5,5
980,EatWell,"We hosted a small group for dinner and the service was really outstanding, one of the best servers we have had the good fortune to experience. The appetizers and small plates were also excellent, as we have come to expect as long time customers. Unfortunately the $60 Black Salt crab cakes were mostly soggy breading with a hint of crab. Something must have gone wrong in the kitchen, so unlike their normal high standards.",4,4,5,4
981,DonJuan,"When I go out for dinner I order fish very often, and I often eat at high end (expensive) restaurants.  The Canadian halibut I had at Black Salt was the est fish I ever had at a restaurant in Washington, DC.  My wife had the branzino and she loved it.",5,5,5,5
982,LadyBrit,"Thank you to all the BlackSalt staff for continued excellent food, drinks, and service.",5,5,5,5
983,RebC,Very well prepared seafood with some bolder flavors. Much enjoyed.,5,4,5,4
984,cb0727,I really enjoy this place. Device was excellent as was most of the food. The halibut was a bit dry and bland‚Ä¶.,5,4,5,5
985,Tara,"Outstanding and beautifully presented food and service, totally  the price. They even kindly brought a delicious birthday cupcake (gratis) for the member of our dining party who was celebrating her birthday.",5,5,5,5
986,MichaelA,"Food is great 
The fish fantastic 
The service was wonderful",5,5,5,4
987,OpenTable Diner,Great food and wine.,5,5,5,5
988,JohnP,Very good experience. Zac was an excellent waiter.,5,4,5,4
989,CliveP,"Black Salt always delivers superb fish dishes. The selection of raw oysters was divine with each with a distinct, but briny (my preference) taste. I opted for the scallop starter as my main and it too was divine with a combination of fava beans and gnocchi. Wine selection nicely pairs with fish. And to top it off, our waiter was personable and professional. One downside was the ""wine room"" where we dined was a little dreary. But all in all the food outshined any downsides.",5,5,5,3
